	<h2 class="chapterhead">Chapter 17—Prayer in the Home Circle</h2>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Families should pray together every morning and evening</strong>—Family worship should not be governed by circumstances. You are not to pray occasionally and, when you have a large day’s work to do, neglect it. In thus doing you lead your children to look upon prayer as of no special consequence. Prayer means very much to the children of God, and thank offerings should come up before God morning and evening. Says the psalmist, “O come, let us sing unto the Lord: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.”</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Fathers and mothers, however pressing your business, do not fail to gather your family around God’s altar. Ask for the guardianship of holy angels in your home. Remember that your dear ones are exposed to temptations.</p>
	<p class="standard-noindent">In our efforts for the comfort and happiness of guests, let us not overlook our obligations to God. The hour of prayer should not be neglected for any consideration. Do not talk and amuse yourselves till all are too weary to enjoy the season of devotion. To <span class="pagebreak">[190]</span> do this is to present to God a lame offering. At an early hour of the evening, when we can pray unhurriedly and understandingly, we should present our supplications and raise our voices in happy, grateful praise.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Let all who visit Christians see that the hour of prayer is the most precious, the most sacred, and the happiest hour of the day. These seasons of devotion exert a refining, elevating influence upon all who participate in them. They bring a peace and rest grateful to the spirit.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="CG 520.1">Child Guidance, 520, 521</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">The Lord has a special interest in the families of His children here below. Angels offer the smoke of the fragrant incense for the praying saints. Then in every family let prayer ascend to heaven both at morning and at the cool sunset hour, in our behalf presenting before God the Saviour’s merits. Morning and evening the heavenly universe takes notice of every praying household.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="ML 29.1">My Life Today, 29</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Morning and evening the heavenly universe behold every household that prays, and the angel with the incense, representing the blood of the atonement, finds access to God.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="7BC 971.1">SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, 971</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">In the morning the Christian’s first thoughts should be upon God. Worldly labor and self-interest should be secondary. Children should be taught to respect and reverence the hour of prayer.... It is the duty of Christian parents, morning and evening, by earnest prayer and persevering faith, to make a hedge about their children. They should patiently instruct them—kindly and untiringly teach them how to live in order to please God.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="CG 519.1">Child Guidance, 519</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">In every Christian home God should be honored by the morning and evening sacrifices of prayer and praise. Children should be taught to respect and reverence the hour of prayer. It is the duty <span class="pagebreak">[191]</span> of Christian parents, morning and evening, by earnest prayer and persevering faith, to make a hedge about their children.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">In the church at home the children are to learn to pray and to trust in God. Teach them to repeat God’s law. Concerning the commandments the Israelites were instructed: “Thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Deuteronomy 6:7">Deuteronomy 6:7</span>. Come in humility, with a heart full of tenderness, and with a sense of the temptations and dangers before yourselves and your children; by faith bind them to the altar, entreating for them the care of the Lord. Train the children to offer their simple words of prayer. Tell them that God delights to have them call upon Him.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="CT 110.1">Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 110</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Before leaving the house for labor, all the family should be called together; and the father, or the mother in the father’s absence, should plead fervently with God to keep them through the day. Come in humility, with a heart full of tenderness, and with a sense of the temptations and dangers before yourselves and your children; by faith bind them upon the altar, entreating for them the care of the Lord. Ministering angels will guard children who are thus dedicated to God.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="CG 519.1">Child Guidance, 519</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Families should have fixed times for morning and evening prayer</strong>—In every family there should be a fixed time for morning and evening worship. How appropriate it is for parents to gather their children about them before the fast is broken, to thank the heavenly Father for His protection during the night, and to ask Him for His help and guidance and watch care during the day! How fitting, also, when evening comes, for parents and children to gather once more before Him and thank Him for the blessings of the day that is past!—(<span class="egw-eng" title="CG 520.1">Child Guidance, 520</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[192]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Family prayer is essential</strong>—Private prayer, family prayer, prayer in public gatherings for the worship of God—all are essential. And we are to live our prayers. We are to co-operate with Christ in His work.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="7T 239.1">Testimonies for the Church 7:239</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Nothing so sad as a home without prayer</strong>—I know of nothing that causes me so great sadness as a prayerless home. I do not feel safe in such a house for a single night; and were it not for the hope of helping the parents to realize their necessity and their sad neglect, I would not remain. The children show the result of this neglect, for the fear of God is not before them.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="CG 518.1">Child Guidance, 518</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Every home to be a house of prayer</strong>—If ever there was a time when every house should be a house of prayer it is now.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="7T 42.1">Testimonies for the Church 7:42</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Family prayer places us in God’s direct presence</strong>—Prayer, whether offered in the public assembly, at the family altar, or in secret, places man directly in the presence of God. By constant prayer the youth may obtain principles so firm that the most powerful temptations will not draw them from their allegiance to God.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="ML 18.1">My Life Today, 18</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Family prayer brings strength and blessings</strong>—We should pray to God much more than we do. There is great strength and blessing in praying together in our families, with and for our children. When my children have done wrong, and I have talked with them kindly and then prayed with them, I have never found it necessary after that to punish them. Their hearts would melt in tenderness before the Holy Spirit that came in answer to prayer.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="CG 525.1">Child Guidance, 525</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Simple language is the most appropriate for prayer</strong>—High-flown language is inappropriate in prayer, whether the petition be <span class="pagebreak">[193]</span> offered in the pulpit, in the family circle, or in secret. Especially should the one offering public prayer use simple language, that others may understand what is said and unite with the petition.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">It is the heart-felt prayer of faith that is heard in heaven and answered on earth.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="GW 177.1">Gospel Workers, 177</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Teach your children to respect the time for prayer</strong>—Your children should be educated to be kind, thoughtful of others, gentle, easy to be entreated, and, above everything else, to respect religious things and feel the importance of the claims of God. They should be taught to respect the hour of prayer; they should be required to rise in the morning so as to be present at family worship.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="CG 521.1">Child Guidance, 521</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayers for our family are best prayed at home</strong>—We should not come to the house of God to pray for our families unless deep feeling shall lead us while the Spirit of God is convicting them. Generally, the proper place to pray for our families is at the family altar. When the subjects of our prayers are at a distance, the closet is the proper place to plead with God for them. When in the house of God, we should pray for a present blessing and should expect God to hear and answer our prayers. Such meetings will be lively and interesting.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="1T 145.1">Testimonies for the Church 1:145, 146</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>The Lord does not accept family worship that has become a mere form</strong>—In many cases the morning and evening worship is little more than a mere form, a dull, monotonous repetition of set phrases in which the spirit of gratitude or the sense of need finds no expression. The Lord accepts not such service. But the petitions of a humble heart and contrite spirit He will not despise. The opening of our hearts to our heavenly Father, the acknowledgment of our entire dependence, the expression of our wants, the homage of grateful love—this is true prayer.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="CG 518.1">Child Guidance, 518</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[194]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-noindent"><strong>Parents need to pray for wisdom to train their children wisely</strong>—Every family should rear its altar of prayer, realizing that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. If any persons in the world need the strength and encouragement that religion gives, it is those who are responsible for the education and training of children. They cannot do their work in a manner acceptable to God while their daily example teaches those who look to them for guidance that they can live without God. If they educate their children to live for this life only, they will make no preparation for eternity. They will die as they have lived, without God, and parents will be called to account for the loss of their souls. Fathers, mothers, you need to seek God morning and evening at the family altar, that you may learn how to teach your children wisely, tenderly, lovingly.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="CG 517.1">Child Guidance, 517</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">You have brought children into the world who have had no voice in regard to their existence. You have made yourselves responsible in a great measure for their future happiness, their eternal well-being. The burden is upon you, whether you are sensible of it or not, to train these children for God, to watch with jealous care the first approach of the wily foe and be prepared to raise a standard against him. Build a fortification of prayer and faith about your children, and exercise diligent watching thereunto. You are not secure a moment against the attacks of Satan.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="2T 397.1">Testimonies for the Church 2:397, 398</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Let parents seek God for guidance in their work. On their knees before Him they will gain a true understanding of their great responsibilities and there they can commit their children to One who will never err in counsel and instruction.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="AH 321.1">The Adventist Home, 321</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">By sincere, earnest prayer parents should make a hedge about their children. They should pray with full faith that God will abide with them, and that holy angels will guard them and their children <span class="pagebreak">[195]</span> from Satan’s cruel power.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="7T 42.1">Testimonies for the Church 7:42, 43</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Patiently, lovingly, as faithful stewards of the manifold grace of Christ, parents are to do their appointed work. It is expected of them that they will be found faithful. Everything is to be done in faith. Constantly they must pray that God will impart His grace to their children. Never must they become weary, impatient, or fretful in their work. They must cling closely to their children and to God. If parents work in patience and love, earnestly endeavoring to help their children to reach the highest standard of purity and modesty, they will succeed.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="AH 208.1">The Adventist Home, 208</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Without human effort divine effort is in vain. God will work with power when in trustful dependence upon Him parents will awake to the sacred responsibility resting upon them, and seek to train their children aright. He will co-operate with those parents who carefully and prayerfully educate their children, working out their own and their children’s salvation. He will work in them, to will and to do of His own good pleasure.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="AH 206.1">The Adventist Home, 206, 207</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Parents, are you working with unflagging energy in behalf of your children? The God of heaven marks your solicitude, your earnest work, your constant watchfulness. He hears your prayers. With patience and tenderness train your children for the Lord. All heaven is interested in your work. Angels of light will unite with you as you strive to lead your children to heaven. God will unite with you, crowning your efforts with success. Christ delights to honor a Christian family; for such a family is a symbol of the family in heaven.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="RH 1-29-1901">The Review and Herald, January 29, 1901</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>The great importance of a mother’s prayers</strong>—Those who keep the law of God look upon their children with indefinable feelings of hope and fear, wondering what part they will act in the <span class="pagebreak">[196]</span> great conflict that is just before them. The anxious mother questions, “What stand will they take? What can I do to prepare them to act well their part, so that they will be the recipients of eternal glory?” Great responsibilities rest upon you, mothers. Although you may not stand in national councils, ... you may do a great work for God and your country. You may educate your children. You may aid them to develop characters that will not be swayed or influenced to do evil, but will sway and influence others to do right. By your fervent prayers of faith you can move the arm that moves the world.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="AH 264.1">The Adventist Home, 264</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">The influence of a praying, God-fearing mother will last through eternity. She may die, but her work will endure.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="4T 500.1">Testimonies for the Church 4:500</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Did mothers but realize the importance of their mission, they would be much in secret prayer, presenting their children to Jesus, imploring His blessing upon them, and pleading for wisdom to discharge aright their sacred duties. Let the mother improve every opportunity to mold and fashion the disposition and habits of her children. Let her watch carefully the development of character, repressing traits that are too prominent, encouraging those that are deficient. Let her make her own life a pure and noble example to her precious charge.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">The mother should enter upon her work with courage and energy, relying constantly upon divine aid in all her efforts. She should never rest satisfied until she sees in her children a gradual elevation of character, until they have a higher object in life than merely to seek their own pleasure.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">It is impossible to estimate the power of a praying mother’s influence. She acknowledges God in all her ways. She takes her children before the throne of grace and presents them to Jesus, pleading for His blessing upon them. The influence of those prayers is to those children as “a wellspring of life.” These prayers, offered in faith, are the support and strength of the Christian mother. To <span class="pagebreak">[197]</span> neglect the duty of praying with our children is to lose one of the greatest blessings within our reach, one of the greatest helps amid the perplexities, cares, and burdens of our lifework.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">The power of a mother’s prayers cannot be too highly estimated. She who kneels beside her son and daughter through the vicissitudes of childhood, through the perils of youth, will never know till the judgment the influence of her prayers upon the life of her children. If she is connected by faith with the Son of God, the mother’s tender hand may hold back her son from the power of temptation, may restrain her daughter from indulging in sin. When passion is warring for the mastery, the power of love, the restraining, earnest, determined influence of the mother, may balance the soul on the side of right.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="AH 265.1">The Adventist Home, 265, 266</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">The prayers of Christian mothers are not disregarded by the Father of all, who sent His Son to the earth to ransom a people for Himself. He will not turn away your petitions and leave you and yours to the buffetings of Satan in the great day of final conflict. It is for you to work with simplicity and faithfulness, and God will establish the work of your hands.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="CG 526.1">Child Guidance, 526</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Family prayer is important, but other types of prayer are needed as well</strong>—Family or public prayer alone is not sufficient. Secret prayer is very important; in solitude the soul is laid bare to the inspecting eye of God, and every motive is scrutinized. Secret prayer! How precious! The soul communing with God! Secret prayer is to be heard only by the prayer-hearing God. No curious ear is to receive the burden of such petitions.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="2T 189.1">Testimonies for the Church 2:189, 190</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[198]</span> </p>
