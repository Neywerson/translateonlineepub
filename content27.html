	<h2 class="chapterhead">Chapter 27—Satan and Prayer</h2>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Satan tries to obstruct our prayer access to God</strong>—The darkness of the evil one encloses those who neglect to pray. The whispered temptations of the enemy entice them to sin; and it is all because they do not make use of the privileges that God has given them in the divine appointment of prayer. Why should the sons and daughters of God be reluctant to pray, when prayer is the key in the hand of faith to unlock heaven’s storehouse, where are treasured the boundless resources of Omnipotence? Without unceasing prayer and diligent watching we are in danger of growing careless and of deviating from the right path. The adversary seeks continually to obstruct the way to the mercy seat, that we may not by earnest supplication and faith obtain grace and power to resist temptation.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="SC 94.1">Steps to Christ, 94, 95</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">There is a mighty power in prayer. Our great adversary is constantly seeking to keep the troubled soul away from God. An appeal to heaven by the humblest saint is more to be dreaded by Satan than the decrees of cabinets or the mandates of kings.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="2BC 1008.1">The S.D.A. Bible Commentary 2:1008</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[268]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-indented">The enemy holds many of you from prayer, by telling you that you do not feel your prayers, and that you would better wait until you realize more of the spirit of intercession, lest your prayers should be a mockery. But you must say to Satan, “It is written” that “men ought always to pray, and not to faint.” We should pray until we do have the burden of our wants upon our souls; and if we persevere, we shall have it. The Lord will imbue us with His Holy Spirit. The Lord knows, and the Devil knows, that we cannot resist the temptations of Satan without power from on high. For this reason the evil one seeks to hinder us from laying hold upon Him who is mighty to save. Our Lord made it our duty, as well as our privilege, to connect our weakness, our ignorance, our need, with His strength, His wisdom, His righteousness. He unites His infinite power with the effort of finite beings, that they may be more than victors in the battle with the enemy of their souls.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Let no one be discouraged, for Jesus lives to make intercession for us. There is a heaven to gain, and a hell to escape, and Christ is interested in our welfare. He will help all those who call upon Him. We must mingle faith with all our prayers. We cannot bring Christ down, but, through faith, we can lift ourselves up into unity and harmony with the perfect standard of righteousness. We have a wily foe to meet and to conquer, but we can do it in the name of the Mighty One.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="RH 10-30-1888">The Review and Herald, October 30, 1888</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Don’t let Satan’s suggestions keep you from praying</strong>—We are not to be so overwhelmed with the thought of our sins and errors that we shall cease to pray. Some realize their great weakness and sin, and become discouraged. Satan casts his dark shadow between them and the Lord Jesus, their atoning sacrifice. They say, It is useless for me to pray. My prayers are so mingled with evil thoughts that the Lord will not hear them.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">These suggestions are from Satan. In His humanity Christ met and resisted this temptation, and He knows how to succor those who are thus tempted. In our behalf, He “offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears” (<span class="bible-kjv" title="Hebrews 5:7">Hebrews 5:7</span>). <span class="pagebreak">[269]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-noindent">Many, not understanding that their doubts come from Satan, become fainthearted and are defeated in the conflict. Do not, because your thoughts are evil, cease to pray. If we could in our own wisdom and strength pray aright, we could also live aright, and would need no atoning sacrifice. But imperfection is upon all humanity. Educate and train the mind that you may in simplicity tell the Lord what you need. As you offer your petitions to God, seeking for forgiveness for sin, a purer and holier atmosphere will surround your soul.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="HP 78.1">In Heavenly Places, 78</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer baffles Satan’s strongest efforts</strong>—Man is Satan’s captive and is naturally inclined to follow his suggestions and do his bidding. He has in himself no power to oppose effectual resistance to evil. It is only as Christ abides in him by living faith, influencing his desires and strengthening him with strength from above, that man may venture to face so terrible a foe. Every other means of defense is utterly vain. It is only through Christ that Satan’s power is limited. This is a momentous truth that all should understand. Satan is busy every moment, going to and fro, walking up and down in the earth, seeking whom he may devour. But the earnest prayer of faith will baffle his strongest efforts. Then take “the shield of faith,” brethren, “wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.”(<span class="egw-eng" title="5T 294.1">Testimonies for the Church 5:294</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer turns aside Satan’s attacks</strong>—Prayer unites us with one another and with God. Prayer brings Jesus to our side, and gives to the fainting, perplexed soul new strength to overcome the world, the flesh, and the devil. Prayer turns aside the attacks of Satan.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="COL 250.1">Christ’s Object Lessons, 250</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">We must have on the whole armor of God and be ready at any moment for a conflict with the powers of darkness. When temptations and trials rush in upon us, let us go to God and agonize with Him in prayer. He will not turn us away empty, but will give <span class="pagebreak">[270]</span> us grace and strength to overcome, and to break the power of the enemy.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="EW 46.1">Early Writings, 46</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Satan trembles at the sound of prayer</strong>—If Satan sees that he is in danger of losing one soul, he will exert himself to the utmost to keep that one. And when the individual is aroused to his danger, and, with distress and fervor, looks to Jesus for strength, Satan fears that he will lose a captive, and he calls a reinforcement of his angels to hedge in the poor soul, and form a wall of darkness around him, that heaven’s light may not reach him. But if the one in danger perseveres, and in his helplessness casts himself upon the merits of the blood of Christ, our Saviour listens to the earnest prayer of faith, and sends a reinforcement of those angels that excel in strength to deliver him. Satan cannot endure to have his powerful rival appealed to, for he fears and trembles before His strength and majesty. At the sound of fervent prayer, Satan’s whole host trembles. He continues to call legions of evil angels to accomplish his object. And when angels, all-powerful, clothed with the armory of heaven, come to the help of the fainting, pursued soul, Satan and his host fall back, well knowing that their battle is lost. The willing subjects of Satan are faithful, active, and united in one object. And although they hate and war with one another, yet they improve every opportunity to advance their common interest. But the great Commander in heaven and earth has limited Satan’s power.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="1T 345.1">Testimonies for the Church 1:345, 346</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Satan dreads prayer by the humblest saint</strong>—There is a mighty power in prayer. Our great adversary is constantly seeking to keep the troubled soul away from God. An appeal to heaven by the humblest saint is more to be dreaded by Satan than the decrees of cabinets or the mandates of kings.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="2BC 1008.1">The S.D.A. Bible Commentary 2:1008</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer is a weapon against Satan</strong>—Beware how you neglect secret prayer and a study of God’s word. These are your weapons <span class="pagebreak">[271]</span> against him who is striving to hinder your progress heavenward. The first neglect of prayer and Bible study makes easier the second neglect. The first resistance to the Spirit’s pleading prepares the way for the second resistance. Thus the heart is hardened, and the conscience seared.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MYP 96.1">Messages to Young People, 96</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer breaks the snare of Satan</strong>—When we feel the least inclined to commune with Jesus, let us pray the most. By so doing we shall break Satan’s snare, the clouds of darkness will disappear, and we shall realize the sweet presence of Jesus.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="LHU 372.1">Lift Him Up, 372</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer prevails against Satan</strong>—The prayer of faith is the great strength of the Christian, and will assuredly prevail against Satan. This is why he insinuates that we have no need of prayer. The name of Jesus, our Advocate, he detests; and when we earnestly come to Him for help, Satan’s host is alarmed. It serves his purpose well if we neglect the exercise of prayer, for then his lying wonders are more readily received.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="1T 296.1">Testimonies for the Church 1:296</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer especially necessary at critical moments in our conflict with Satan</strong>—In the conflict with satanic agencies there are decisive moments that determine the victory either on the side of God or on the side of the prince of this world. If those engaged in the warfare are not wide awake, earnest, vigilant, praying for wisdom, watching unto prayer, ... Satan comes off victor, when he might have been vanquished by the armies of the Lord.... God’s faithful sentinels are to give the evil powers no advantage.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="6BC 1094.1">The S.D.A. Bible Commentary 6:1094</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Satan enraged by fervent prayer</strong>—Satan leads many to believe that prayer to God is useless and but a form. He well knows how needful are meditation and prayer to keep Christ’s followers aroused to resist his cunning and deception. By his devices he would divert the mind from these important exercises, that the <span class="pagebreak">[272]</span> soul may not lean for help upon the Mighty One and obtain strength from Him to resist his attacks. I was pointed to the fervent, effectual prayers of God’s people anciently. “Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly.” Daniel prayed unto his God three times a day. Satan is enraged at the sound of fervent prayer, for he knows that he will suffer loss.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="1T 295.1">Testimonies for the Church 1:295</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Satan rejoices when prayers are spoken indistinctly</strong>—Let those who pray and those who speak pronounce their words properly and speak in clear, distinct, even tones. Prayer, if properly offered, is a power for good. It is one of the means used by the Lord to communicate to the people the precious treasures of truth. But prayer is not what it should be, because of the defective voices of those who utter it. Satan rejoices when the prayers offered to God are almost inaudible. Let God’s people learn how to speak and pray in a way that will properly represent the great truths they possess. Let the testimonies borne and the prayers offered be clear and distinct. Thus God will be glorified.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="6T 382.1">Testimonies for the Church 6:382</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Satan tries to convince us that prayer is not necessary</strong>—The idea that prayer is not essential is one of Satan’s most successful devices to ruin souls. Prayer is communion with God, the Fountain of wisdom, the Source of strength, and peace, and happiness.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="CG 518.1">Child Guidance, 518</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Satan sees the Lord’s servants burdened because of the spiritual darkness that enshrouds the people. He hears their earnest prayers for divine grace and power to break the spell of indifference, carelessness, and indolence. Then with renewed zeal he plies his arts. He tempts men to the indulgence of appetite or to some other form of self-gratification, and thus benumbs their sensibilities so that they fail to hear the very things which they most need to learn. <span class="pagebreak">[273]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-noindent">Satan well knows that all whom he can lead to neglect prayer and the searching of the Scriptures, will be overcome by his attacks. Therefore he invents every possible device to engross the mind. There has ever been a class professing godliness, who, instead of following on to know the truth, make it their religion to seek some fault of character or error of faith in those with whom they do not agree. Such are Satan’s right-hand helpers. Accusers of the brethren are not few, and they are always active when God is at work and His servants are rendering Him true homage. They will put a false coloring upon the words and acts of those who love and obey the truth. They will represent the most earnest, zealous, self-denying servants of Christ as deceived or deceivers. It is their work to misrepresent the motives of every true and noble deed, to circulate insinuations, and arouse suspicion in the minds of the inexperienced. In every conceivable manner they will seek to cause that which is pure and righteous to be regarded as foul and deceptive.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="GC 519.1">The Great Controversy, 519</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[274]</span> </p>
