	<h2 class="chapterhead">Chapter 14—Daily Prayer</h2>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>As essential as our daily food</strong>—If we would develop a character which God can accept, we must form correct habits in our religious life. Daily prayer is as essential to growth in grace, and even to spiritual life itself, as is temporal food to physical wellbeing. We should accustom ourselves to often lift the thoughts to God in prayer. If the mind wanders, we must bring it back; by persevering effort, habit will finally make it easy. We cannot for one moment separate ourselves from Christ with safety. We may have His presence to attend us at every step, but only by observing the conditions which He has Himself laid down.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MYP 114.1">Messages to Young People, 114, 115</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Our need of daily prayer</strong>—All who come to Christ today are to remember that His merit is the incense that mingles with the prayers of those who repent of their sins and receive pardon and mercy and grace. Our need of Christ’s intercession is constant. Day by day, morning and evening, the humble heart needs to offer up prayers to which will be returned answers of grace and peace and joy. “By Him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God <span class="pagebreak">[156]</span> continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to His name. But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifice God is well pleased”(<span class="egw-eng" title="6BC 1078.1">SDA Bible Commentary 6:1078</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Begin your day with prayer</strong>—It is our privilege to open our hearts, and let the sunshine of Christ’s presence in. My brother, my sister, face the light. Come into actual, personal contact with Christ, that you may exert an influence that is uplifting and reviving. Let your faith be strong and pure and steadfast. Let gratitude to God fill your hearts. When you rise in the morning, kneel at your bedside, and ask God to give you strength to fulfil the duties of the day, and to meet its temptations. Ask Him to help you to bring into your work Christ’s sweetness of character. Ask Him to help you to speak words that will inspire those around you with hope and courage, and draw you nearer to the Saviour.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="SD 199.1">Sons and Daughters of God, 199</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Every morning take time to begin your work with prayer. Do not think this wasted time; it is time that will live through eternal ages. By this means success and spiritual victory will be brought in. The machinery will respond to the touch of the Master’s hand. God’s blessing is certainly worth asking for, and the work cannot be done aright unless the beginning is right.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="7T 194.1">Testimonies for the Church 7:194</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">My brethren and sisters, old and young, when you have an hour of leisure, open the Bible and store the mind with its precious truths. When engaged in labor, guard the mind, keep it stayed upon God, talk less, and meditate more. Remember: “Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.” Let your words be select; this will close a door against the adversary of souls. Let your day be entered upon with prayer; work as in God’s sight. His angels are ever by your side, making a record of your words, your deportment, and the manner in which your work is done. If you turn from good counsel and choose to associate with those who you have reason to suspect are <span class="pagebreak">[157]</span> not religiously inclined, although they profess to be Christians, you will soon become like them. You place yourself in the way of temptation, on Satan’s battleground, and will, unless constantly guarded, be overcome by his devices.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="4T 588.1">Testimonies for the Church 4:588, 589</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Go daily to the Lord for instruction and guidance; depend upon God for light and knowledge. Pray for this instruction and this light, until you get it. It will not avail for you to ask, and then forget the thing for which you prayed. Keep your mind upon your prayer. You can do this while working with your hands. You can say, Lord, I believe; with all my heart I believe Let the Holy Spirit’s power come upon me.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="FE 531.1">Fundamentals of Christian Education, 531</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">In following Christ, looking unto Him who is the Author and Finisher of your faith, you will feel that you are working under His eye, that you are influenced by His presence, and that He knows your motives. At every step you will humbly inquire: Will this please Jesus? Will it glorify God? Morning and evening your earnest prayers should ascend to God for His blessing and guidance. True prayer takes hold upon Omnipotence and gives us the victory. Upon his knees the Christian obtains strength to resist temptation.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="4T 615.1">Testimonies for the Church 4:615</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Devote some time every day to prayer</strong>—Those who will put on the whole armor of God and devote some time every day to meditation and prayer and to the study of the Scriptures will be connected with heaven and will have a saving, transforming influence upon those around them. Great thoughts, noble aspirations, clear perceptions of truth and duty to God, will be theirs. They will be yearning for purity, for light, for love, for all the graces of heavenly birth. Their earnest prayers will enter into that within the veil. This class will have a sanctified boldness to come into the presence of the Infinite One. They will feel that heaven’s light and glories are for them, and they will become refined, elevated, ennobled <span class="pagebreak">[158]</span> by this intimate acquaintance with God. Such is the privilege of true Christians.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Abstract meditation is not enough; busy action is not enough; both are essential to the formation of Christian character. Strength acquired in earnest, secret prayer prepares us to withstand the allurements of society. And yet we should not exclude ourselves from the world, for our Christian experience is to be the light of the world. The society of unbelievers will do us no harm if we mingle with them for the purpose of connecting them with God and are strong enough spiritually to withstand their influence.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="5T 112.1">Testimonies for the Church 5:112, 113</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>The results of daily prayer</strong>—The soul that turns to God for its help, its support, its power, by daily, earnest prayer, will have noble aspirations, clear perceptions of truth and duty, lofty purposes of action, and a continual hungering and thirsting after righteousness. By maintaining a connection with God, we shall be enabled to diffuse to others, through our association with them, the light, the peace, the serenity, that rule in our hearts. The strength acquired in prayer to God, united with persevering effort in training the mind in thoughtfulness and care-taking, prepares one for daily duties and keeps the spirit in peace under all circumstances.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">If we draw near to God, He will put a word in our mouth to speak for Him, even praise unto His name. He will teach us a strain from the song of the angels, even thanksgiving to our heavenly Father. In every act of life, the light and love of an indwelling Saviour will be revealed. Outward troubles cannot reach the life that is lived by faith in the Son of God.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MB 85.1">Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing, 85</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer needed daily to resist Satan</strong>—Sanctification is not the work of a moment, an hour, or a day. It is a continual growth in grace. We know not one day how strong will be our conflict the next. Satan lives, and is active, and every day we need to cry earnestly to God for help and strength to resist him. As long as Satan reigns we shall have <span class="pagebreak">[159]</span> self to subdue, besetments to overcome, and there is no stopping place, there is no point to which we can come and say we have fully attained.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="1T 340.1">Testimonies for the Church 1:340</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Daily prayer to include both physical and spiritual needs</strong>—The prayer for daily bread includes not only food to sustain the body, but that spiritual bread which will nourish the soul unto life everlasting. Jesus bids us, “Labor not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="John 6:27">John 6:27</span>. He says, “I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live forever.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="John 6:51">Verse 51</span>. Our Saviour is the bread of life, and it is by beholding His love, by receiving it into the soul, that we feed upon the bread which came down from heaven.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">We receive Christ through His word, and the Holy Spirit is given to open the word of God to our understanding, and bring home its truths to our hearts. We are to pray day by day that as we read His word, God will send His Spirit to reveal to us the truth that will strengthen our souls for the day’s need.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">In teaching us to ask every day for what we need—both temporal and spiritual blessings—God has a purpose to accomplish for our good. He would have us realize our dependence upon His constant care, for He is seeking to draw us into communion with Himself. In this communion with Christ, through prayer and the study of the great and precious truths of His word, we shall as hungry souls be fed; as those that thirst, we shall be refreshed at the fountain of life.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MB 112.1">Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing, 112, 113</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Like the early Christians, we need to pray daily for the holy spirit</strong>—Those who at Pentecost were endued with power from on high, were not thereby freed from further temptation and trial. As they witnessed for truth and righteousness they were repeatedly assailed by the enemy of all truth, who sought to rob them of their Christian experience. They were compelled to strive with all their God-given powers to reach the measure of the stature of men and women in Christ Jesus. Daily they prayed for fresh <span class="pagebreak">[160]</span> supplies of grace, that they might reach higher and still higher toward perfection. Under the Holy Spirit’s working even the weakest, by exercising faith in God, learned to improve their entrusted powers and to become sanctified, refined, and ennobled. As in humility they submitted to the molding influence of the Holy Spirit, they received of the fullness of the Godhead and were fashioned in the likeness of the divine.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">The lapse of time has wrought no change in Christ’s parting promise to send the Holy Spirit as His representative. It is not because of any restriction on the part of God that the riches of His grace do not flow earthward to men. If the fulfillment of the promise is not seen as it might be, it is because the promise is not appreciated as it should be. If all were willing, all would be filled with the Spirit. Wherever the need of the Holy Spirit is a matter little thought of, there is seen spiritual drought, spiritual darkness, spiritual declension and death. Whenever minor matters occupy the attention, the divine power which is necessary for the growth and prosperity of the church, and which would bring all other blessings in its train, is lacking, though offered in infinite plenitude.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Since this is the means by which we are to receive power, why do we not hunger and thirst for the gift of the Spirit? Why do we not talk of it, pray for it, and preach concerning it? The Lord is more willing to give the Holy Spirit to those who serve Him than parents are to give good gifts to their children. For the daily baptism of the Spirit every worker should offer his petition to God. Companies of Christian workers should gather to ask for special help, for heavenly wisdom, that they may know how to plan and execute wisely. Especially should they pray that God will baptize His chosen ambassadors in mission fields with a rich measure of His Spirit. The presence of the Spirit with God’s workers will give the proclamation of truth a power that not all the honor or glory of the world could give.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="AA 49.1">The Acts of the Apostles, 49-51</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Pray for grace for each day’s needs</strong>—The truth of God received into the heart is able to make you wise unto salvation. In <span class="pagebreak">[161]</span> believing and obeying it you will receive grace sufficient for the duties and trials of today. Grace for tomorrow you do not need. You should feel that you have only to do with today. Overcome for today; deny self for today; watch and pray for today; obtain victories in God for today. Our circumstances and surroundings, the changes daily transpiring around us, and the written word of God which discerns and proves all things—these are sufficient to teach us our duty and just what we ought to do, day by day. Instead of suffering your mind to run in a channel of thought from which you will derive no benefit, you should be searching the Scriptures daily and doing those duties in daily life which may now be irksome to you, but which must be done by someone.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="3T 333.1">Testimonies for the Church 3:333</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Pray daily for understanding of the bible</strong>—Those who profess to believe in Jesus, should ever press to the light. They should daily pray for the light of the Holy Spirit to shine upon the pages of the sacred book, that they may be enabled to comprehend the things of the Spirit of God.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="FE 188.1">Fundamentals of Christian Education, 188, 189</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Pray daily for the blessing the sabbath brings</strong>—All who regard the Sabbath as a sign between them and God, showing that He is the God who sanctifies them, will represent the principles of His government. They will bring into daily practice the laws of His kingdom. Daily it will be their prayer that the sanctification of the Sabbath may rest upon them. Every day they will have the companionship of Christ and will exemplify the perfection of His character. Every day their light will shine forth to others in good works.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="6T 353.1">Testimonies for the Church 6:353</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>A parent’s daily prayer</strong>—Make your work pleasant with songs of praise. If you would have a clean record in the books of heaven, never fret or scold. Let your daily prayer be, “Lord, teach me to do my best. Teach me how to do better work. Give me energy and <span class="pagebreak">[162]</span> cheerfulness.” ... Bring Christ into all that you do. Then your lives will be filled with brightness and thanksgiving.... Let us do our best, moving forward cheerfully in the service of the Lord, with our hearts filled with His joy.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="CG 148.1">Child Guidance, 148</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Youth to pray daily for wisdom and grace</strong>—The trials and privations of which so many youth complain, Christ endured without murmuring. And this discipline is the very experience the youth need, which will give firmness to their characters, and make them like Christ, strong in spirit to resist temptation. They will not, if they separate from the influence of those who would lead them astray and corrupt their morals, be overcome by the devices of Satan. Through daily prayer to God, they will have wisdom and grace from Him to bear the conflict and stern realities of life, and come off victorious. Fidelity and serenity of mind can only be retained by watchfulness and prayer. Christ’s life was an example of persevering energy, which was not allowed to become weakened by reproach, ridicule, privation or hardships.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Thus should it be with the youth. If trials increase upon them, they may know that God is testing and proving their fidelity. And in just that degree that they maintain their integrity of character under discouragements, will their fortitude, stability, and power of endurance increase, and they wax strong in spirit.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MYP 80.1">Messages to Young People, 80</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>The teacher’s need of daily prayer</strong>—Every teacher should daily receive instruction from Christ and should labor constantly under His guidance. It is impossible for him rightly to understand or to perform his work unless he is much with God in prayer. Only by divine aid, combined with earnest, self-denying effort, can he hope to do his work wisely and well.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Unless the teacher realizes the need of prayer and humbles his heart before God, he will lose the very essence of education. He should know how to pray and what language to use in prayer. “I am the vine,” Jesus said, “ye are the branches: he that abideth in Me, and I in <span class="pagebreak">[163]</span> him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without Me ye can do nothing.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="John 15:5">John 15:5</span>. The teacher should let the fruit of faith be manifest in his prayers. He should learn how to come to the Lord and plead with Him until he receives the assurance that his petitions are heard.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="CT 231.1">Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 231</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>In old testament times, the israelites prayed daily</strong>—As the priests’ morning and evening entered the holy place at the time of incense, the daily sacrifice was ready to be offered upon the altar in the court without. This was a time of intense interest to the worshipers who assembled at the tabernacle. Before entering into the presence of God through the ministration of the priest, they were to engage in earnest searching of heart and confession of sin. They united in silent prayer, with their faces toward the holy place. Thus their petitions ascended with the cloud of incense, while faith laid hold upon the merits of the promised Saviour prefigured by the atoning sacrifice. The hours appointed for the morning and the evening sacrifice were regarded as sacred, and they came to be observed as the set time for worship throughout the Jewish nation. And when in later times the Jews were scattered as captives in distant lands, they still at the appointed hour turned their faces toward Jerusalem and offered up their petitions to the God of Israel. In this custom Christians have an example for morning and evening prayer. While God condemns a mere round of ceremonies, without the spirit of worship, He looks with great pleasure upon those who love Him, bowing morning and evening to seek pardon for sins committed and to present their requests for needed blessings.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="PP 353.1">Patriarchs and Prophets, 353, 354</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Daily prayer nutures our religious experience</strong>—Religion must begin with emptying and purifying the heart, and must be nurtured by daily prayer.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="4T 535.1">Testimonies for the Church 4:535</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>A daily prayer life requires earnest effort</strong>—A life of daily prayer and praise, a life which will shed light upon the path of <span class="pagebreak">[164]</span> others, cannot be maintained without earnest effort. But such effort will yield precious fruit, blessing not only the receiver, but the giver. The spirit of unselfish labor for others gives depth, stability, and Christlike loveliness to the character and brings peace and happiness to its possessor. The aspirations are elevated. There is no room for sloth or selfishness. Those who exercise the Christian graces will grow. They will have spiritual sinew and muscle, and will be strong to work for God. They will have clear spiritual perceptions, a steady, increasing faith, and prevailing power in prayer. Those who are watching for souls, who devote themselves most fully to the salvation of the erring, are most surely working out their own salvation.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="5T 607.1">Testimonies for the Church 5:607</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Angels mark the morning prayer</strong>—You all have an influence for good or for evil on the minds and characters of others. And just the influence which you exert is written in the book of records in heaven. An angel is attending you and taking record of your words and actions. When you rise in the morning, do you feel your helplessness and your need of strength from God? and do you humbly, heartily make known your wants to your heavenly Father? If so, angels mark your prayers, and if these prayers have not gone forth out of feigned lips, when you are in danger of unconsciously doing wrong and exerting an influence which will lead others to do wrong, your guardian angel will be by your side, prompting you to a better course, choosing your words for you, and influencing your actions.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">If you feel in no danger, and if you offer no prayer for help and strength to resist temptations, you will be sure to go astray; your neglect of duty will be marked in the book of God in heaven, and you will be found wanting in the trying day.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="3T 363.1">Testimonies for the Church 3:363, 364</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>The practice of daily prayer is not to be followed haphazardly</strong>—Family worship should not be governed by circumstances. You are not to pray occasionally and, when you have a large day’s work to do, neglect it. In thus doing you lead your <span class="pagebreak">[165]</span> children to look upon prayer as of no special consequence. Prayer means very much to the children of God, and thank offerings should come up before God morning and evening. Says the psalmist, “O come, let us sing unto the Lord: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto Him with psalms.”</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Fathers and mothers, however pressing your business, do not fail to gather your family around God’s altar. Ask for the guardianship of holy angels in your home. Remember that your dear ones are exposed to temptations.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">In our efforts for the comfort and happiness of guests, let us not overlook our obligations to God. The hour of prayer should not be neglected for any consideration. Do not talk and amuse yourselves till all are too weary to enjoy the season of devotion. To do this is to present to God a lame offering. At an early hour of the evening, when we can pray unhurriedly and understandingly, we should present our supplications and raise our voices in happy, grateful praise.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Let all who visit Christians see that the hour of prayer is the most precious, the most sacred, and the happiest hour of the day. These seasons of devotion exert a refining, elevating influence upon all who participate in them. They bring a peace and rest grateful to the spirit.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="CG 520.1">Child Guidance, 520, 521</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Daily prayer to ascend to God as sweet incense</strong>—The life of Abraham, the friend of God, was a life of prayer. Wherever he pitched his tent, close beside it was built an altar, upon which were offered the morning and the evening sacrifice. When his tent was removed, the altar remained. And the roving Canaanite, as he came to that altar, knew who had been there. When he had pitched his tent he repaired the altar and worshiped the living God.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">So the homes of Christians should be lights in the world. From them, morning and evening, prayer should ascend to God as sweet incense. And as the morning dew, His mercies and blessings will descend upon the suppliants. <span class="pagebreak">[166]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Fathers and mothers, each morning and evening gather your children around you, and in humble supplication lift the heart to God for help. Your dear ones are exposed to temptation. Daily annoyances beset the path of young and old. Those who would live patient, loving, cheerful lives must pray. Only by receiving constant help from God can we gain the victory over self.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Each morning consecrate yourselves and your children to God for that day. Make no calculation for months or years; these are not yours. One brief day is given you. As if it were your last on earth, work during its hours for the Master. Lay all your plans before God, to be carried out or given up, as His providence shall indicate. Accept His plans instead of your own, even though their acceptance requires the abandonment of cherished projects. Thus the life will be molded more and more after the divine example; “and the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Philippians 4:7">Philippians 4:7</span>.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="7T 44.1">Testimonies for the Church 7:44</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>What to pray for daily</strong>—We are to look upon every duty, however humble, as sacred because it is a part of God’s service. Our daily prayer should be, “Lord, help me to do my best. Teach me how to do better work. Give me energy and cheerfulness. Help me to bring into my service the loving ministry of the Saviour.”(<span class="egw-eng" title="MH 474.1">The Ministry of Healing, 474</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Consecrate yourself to God in the morning; make this your very first work. Let your prayer be, “Take me, O Lord, as wholly Thine. I lay all my plans at Thy feet. Use me today in Thy service. Abide with me, and let all my work be wrought in Thee.” This is a daily matter. Each morning consecrate yourself to God for that day. Surrender all your plans to Him, to be carried out or given up as His providence shall indicate. Thus day by day you may be giving your life into the hands of God, and thus your life will be molded more and more after the life of Christ.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="SC 70.1">Steps to Christ, 70</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[167]</span> </p>
