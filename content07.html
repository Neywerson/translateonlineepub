	<h2 class="chapterhead">Chapter 7—Prayer And Obedience</h2>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Pray and work</strong>—We are not to sit in calm expectancy of oppression and tribulation, and fold our hands, doing nothing to avert the evil. Let our united cries be sent up to heaven. Pray and work, and work and pray. But let none act rashly. Learn as never before that you must be meek and lowly in heart.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="2SM 370.1">Selected Messages 2:370, 371</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">We must pray and work and believe. The Lord is our efficiency.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="Ev 438.1">Evangelism, 438</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">You will have to wrestle with difficulties, carry burdens, give advice, plan and execute, constantly looking to God for help. Pray and labor, labor and pray; as pupils in the school of Christ, learn of Jesus.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="TM 498.1">Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, 498, 499</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer is heaven’s plan for success against sin</strong>—There are many who, though striving to obey God’s commandments, have little peace or joy. This lack in their experience is the result of a failure to exercise faith. They walk as it were in a salt land, a parched <span class="pagebreak">[65]</span> wilderness. They claim little, when they might claim much; for there is no limit to the promises of God. Such ones do not correctly represent the sanctification that comes through obedience to the truth. The Lord would have all His sons and daughters happy, peaceful, and obedient. Through the exercise of faith the believer comes into possession of these blessings. Through faith, every deficiency of character may be supplied, every defilement cleansed, every fault corrected, every excellence developed.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Prayer is heaven’s ordained means of success in the conflict with sin and the development of Christian character. The divine influences that come in answer to the prayer of faith will accomplish in the soul of the suppliant all for which he pleads. For the pardon of sin, for the Holy Spirit, for a Christlike temper, for wisdom and strength to do His work, for any gift He has promised, we may ask; and the promise is, “Ye shall receive.”(<span class="egw-eng" title="AA 563.1">The Acts of the Apostles, 563, 564</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Daily temptations make prayer a necessity</strong>—The strength acquired in prayer to God, united with individual effort in training the mind to thoughtfulness and care-taking, prepares the person for daily duties and keeps the spirit in peace under all circumstances, however trying. The temptations to which we are daily exposed make prayer a necessity. In order that we may be kept by the power of God through faith, the desires of the mind should be continually ascending in silent prayer for help, for light, for strength, for knowledge. But thought and prayer cannot take the place of earnest, faithful improvement of the time. Work and prayer are both required in perfecting Christian character.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="4T 459.1">Testimonies for the Church 4:459</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Daily prayer turns mistakes into victories</strong>—If one who daily communes with God errs from the path, if he turns a moment from looking steadfastly unto Jesus, it is not because he sins willfully; for when he sees his mistake, he turns again, and fastens his eyes upon Jesus, and the fact that he has erred, does not make him less dear to the heart of God. He knows that he has communion <span class="pagebreak">[66]</span> with the Saviour; and when reproved for his mistake in some matter of judgment, he does not walk sullenly, and complain of God, but turns the mistake into a victory. He learns a lesson from the words of the Master, and takes heed that he be not again deceived.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="RH 5-12-1896">The Review and Herald, May 12, 1896</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Christ is the medium of prayer between us and God</strong>—Christ is the connecting link between God and man. He has promised His personal intercession. He places the whole virtue of His righteousness on the side of the suppliant. He pleads for man, and man, in need of divine help, pleads for himself in the presence of God, using the influence of the One who gave His life for the life of the world. As we acknowledge before God our appreciation of Christ’s merits, fragrance is given to our intercessions. As we approach God through the virtue of the Redeemer’s merits, Christ places us close by His side, encircling us with His human arm, while with His divine arm He grasps the throne of the Infinite. He puts His merits, as sweet incense, in the censer in our hands, in order to encourage our petitions. He promises to hear and answer our supplications.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Yes, Christ has become the medium of prayer between man and God. He has also become the medium of blessing between God and man. He has united divinity with humanity. Men are to cooperate with Him for the salvation of their own souls, and then make earnest, persevering efforts to save those who are ready to die.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="8T 178.1">Testimonies for the Church 8:178</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">As the high priest sprinkled the warm blood upon the mercy-seat while the fragrant cloud of incense ascended before God, so, while we confess our sins and plead the efficacy of Christ’s atoning blood, our prayers are to ascend to heaven, fragrant with the merits of our Saviour’s character. Notwithstanding our unworthiness, we are to remember that there is One who can take away sin, and who is willing and anxious to save the sinner. With His own blood He paid the penalty for all wrongdoers. Every sin acknowledged before God with a contrite heart, He will remove. “Though your <span class="pagebreak">[67]</span> sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.”(<span class="egw-eng" title="RH 9-29-1896">The Review and Herald, September 29, 1896</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayers amount to nothing if there is willful iniquity in the heart</strong>—“The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world.” Christ says: “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.” What do your prayers amount to while you regard iniquity in your hearts? Unless you make a thorough change, you will, not far hence, become weary of reproof, as did the children of Israel; and, like them, you will apostatize from God. Some of you in words acknowledge reproof, but you do not in heart accept it. You go on the same as before, only being less susceptible to the influence of the Spirit of God, becoming more and more blinded, having less wisdom, less self-control, less moral power, and less zeal and relish for religious exercises; and, unless converted, you will finally yield your hold upon God entirely. You have not made decided changes in your life when reproof has come, because you have not seen and realized your defects of character and the great contrast between your life and the life of Christ. It has been your policy to place yourselves in a position where you would not entirely lose the confidence of your brethren.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="4T 332.1">Testimonies for the Church 4:332</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer does not take the place of obedience</strong>—There are conditions to the fulfillment of God’s promises, and prayer can never take the place of duty. “If ye love Me,” Christ says, “Keep My commandments.”“He that hath My commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me; and he that loveth Me shall be loved of My Father, and I will love him, and will manifest Myself to him.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="John 14:15">John 14:15, 21</span>. Those who bring their petitions to God, claiming His promise while they do not comply with the conditions, insult Jehovah. They bring the name of Christ as their authority <span class="pagebreak">[68]</span> for the fulfillment of the promise, but they do not those things that would show faith in Christ and love for Him.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Many are forfeiting the condition of acceptance with the Father. We need to examine closely the deed of trust wherewith we approach God. If we are disobedient, we bring to the Lord a note to be cashed when we have not fulfilled the conditions that would make it payable to us. We present to God His promises, and ask Him to fulfill them, when by so doing He would dishonor His own name.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">The promise is “If ye abide in Me, and My words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="John 15:7">John 15:7</span>. And John declares: “Hereby we do know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. He that saith, I know Him, and keepeth not His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoso keepeth His word, in him verily is the love of God perfected.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="1 John 2:3">1 John 2:3-5</span>.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="COL 143.1">Christ’s Object Lessons, 143, 144</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>We are to believe God hears and then live out our prayers</strong>—Children and youth may come to Jesus with their burdens and perplexities, and know that He will respect their appeals to Him, and give them the very things they need. Be earnest; be resolute. Present the promise of God, and then believe without a doubt. Do not wait to feel special emotions before you think the Lord answers. Do not mark out some particular way that the Lord must work for you before you believe you receive the things you ask of Him; but trust His word, and leave the whole matter in the hands of the Lord, with full faith that your prayer will be honored, and the answer will come at the very time and in the very way your heavenly Father sees is for your good; and then live out your prayers. Walk humbly and keep moving forward.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MYP 123.1">Messages to Young People, 123</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Pray for grace to resist temptation</strong>—In the daily life you will meet with sudden surprises, disappointments, and temptations. What saith the word? “Resist the devil,” by firm reliance upon God, “and he will flee from you. Draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you.”“Let him take hold of My strength, that he <span class="pagebreak">[69]</span> may make peace with Me; and he shall make peace with Me.” Look unto Jesus at all times and in all places, offering a silent prayer from a sincere heart that you may know how to do His will. Then when the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard for you against the enemy. When you are almost ready to yield, to lose patience and self-control, to be hard and denunciatory, to find fault and accuse—this is the time for you to send to heaven the prayer, “Help me, O God, to resist temptation, to put all bitterness and wrath and evil-speaking out of my heart. Give me Thy meekness, Thy lowliness, Thy longsuffering, and Thy love. Leave me not to dishonor my Redeemer, to misinterpret the words and motives of my wife, my children, and my brethren and sisters in the faith. Help me that I may be kind, pitiful, tenderhearted, forgiving. Help me to be a real house-band in my home and to represent the character of Christ to others.”(<span class="egw-eng" title="AH 214.1">The Adventist Home, 214, 215</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">We know the dangers and temptations that beset the youth at the present time are not few or small.... We live in an age when to resist evil calls for constant watchfulness and prayer. God’s precious Word is the standard for youth who would be loyal to the King of heaven. Let them study the Scriptures. Let them commit text after text to memory, and acquire a knowledge of what the Lord has said.... And in trial let the youth spread out the Word of God before them, and with humble hearts, and in faith, seek the Lord for wisdom to find out His way, and for strength to walk in it....</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Let our young men institute a warfare against every habit that has the least danger of leading the soul from duty and devotion. Let them have stated seasons for prayer, never neglecting them if it can possibly be avoided. If they go out to battle with their vicious habits indulged as before they professed fellowship with Christ, they will soon fall an easy prey to Satan’s devices. But armed with the Word of God, having it treasured in heart and mind, they will come forth unharmed by all the assaults of the foes of God or man.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="ML 315.1">My Life Today, 315</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[70]</span> </p>
