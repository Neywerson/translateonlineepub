	<h2 class="chapterhead">Chapter 8—Prevailing Prayer</h2>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Do not let go of God’s promises</strong>—Every saint who comes to God with a true heart, and sends his honest petitions to Him in faith, will have his prayers answered. Your faith must not let go of the promises of God, if you do not see or feel the immediate answer to your prayers. Be not afraid to trust God. Rely upon His sure promise: “Ask, and ye shall receive.” God is too wise to err, and too good to withhold any good thing from His saints that walk uprightly. Man is erring, and although his petitions are sent up from an honest heart, he does not always ask for the things that are good for himself, or that will glorify God. When this is so, our wise and good Father hears our prayers, and will answer, sometimes immediately; but He gives us the things that are for our best good and His own glory. God gives us blessings; if we could look into His plan, we would clearly see that He knows what is best for us and that our prayers are answered. Nothing hurtful is given, but the blessing we need, in the place of something we asked for that would not be good for us, but to our hurt.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">I saw that if we do not feel immediate answers to our prayers, we should hold fast our faith, not allowing distrust to come in, for that will separate us from God. If our faith wavers, we shall receive <span class="pagebreak">[71]</span> nothing from Him. Our confidence in God should be strong; and when we need it most, the blessing will fall upon us like a shower of rain.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="1T 120.1">Testimonies for the Church 1:120, 121</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Our prayers are to be earnest and persistent</strong>—God does not say, Ask once, and you shall receive. He bids us ask. Unwearyingly persist in prayer. The persistent asking brings the petitioner into a more earnest attitude, and gives him an increased desire to receive the things for which he asks. Christ said to Martha at the grave of Lazarus, “If thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="John 11:40">John 11:40</span>.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">But many have not a living faith. This is why they do not see more of the power of God. Their weakness is the result of their unbelief. They have more faith in their own working than in the working of God for them. They take themselves into their own keeping. They plan and devise, but pray little, and have little real trust in God. They think they have faith, but it is only the impulse of the moment. Failing to realize their own need, or God’s willingness to give, they do not persevere in keeping their requests before the Lord.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Our prayers are to be as earnest and persistent as was the petition of the needy friend who asked for the loaves at midnight. The more earnestly and steadfastly we ask, the closer will be our spiritual union with Christ. We shall receive increased blessings because we have increased faith.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Our part is to pray and believe. Watch unto prayer. Watch, and co-operate with the prayer-hearing God. Bear in mind that “we are labourers together with God.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="1 Corinthians 3:9">1 Corinthians 3:9</span>. Speak and act in harmony with your prayers. It will make an infinite difference with you whether trial shall prove your faith to be genuine, or show that your prayers are only a form.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="COL 145.1">Christ’s Object Lessons, 145, 146</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Earnest prayer avails much</strong>—That prayer which comes forth from an earnest, believing heart is the effectual, fervent prayer that availeth much. God does not always answer our prayers as we expect, for we may not ask what would be for our highest good; <span class="pagebreak">[72]</span> but in His infinite love and wisdom He will give us those things which we most need.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="4T 531.1">Testimonies for the Church 4:531</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Do not let go of God’s arm too soon</strong>—I asked the angel why there was no more faith and power in Israel. He said, “Ye let go of the arm of the Lord too soon. Press your petitions to the throne, and hold on by strong faith. The promises are sure. Believe ye receive the things ye ask for, and ye shall have them.” I was then pointed to Elijah. He was subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly. His faith endured the trial. Seven times he prayed before the Lord, and at last the cloud was seen. I saw that we had doubted the sure promises, and wounded the Saviour by our lack of faith. Said the angel, “Gird the armor about thee, and above all take the shield of faith; for that will guard the heart, the very life, from the fiery darts of the wicked.” If the enemy can lead the desponding to take their eyes off from Jesus, and look to themselves, and dwell upon their own unworthiness, instead of dwelling upon the worthiness of Jesus, His love, His merits, and His great mercy, he will get away their shield of faith and gain his object; they will be exposed to his fiery temptations. The weak should therefore look to Jesus, and believe in Him; they then exercise faith.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="EW 73.1">Early Writings, 73</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Persist unwearyingly in prayer</strong>—When a man breathes an intensely earnest prayer to God (Jesus Christ is the only name given under heaven whereby we can be saved), there is in that intensity and earnestness a pledge from God that He is about to answer that prayer exceeding abundantly, above all that we can ask or think. We must not only pray in the name of Jesus, but by the inspiration and kindling of the Holy Spirit. This explains what is meant when it is said, “the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which can not be uttered.” The petitions must be offered in earnest faith. Then they will reach the mercy-seat. Unwearyingly persist in prayer. God does not say, Pray once, and I will answer you. His word is pray, be instant in prayer, believing ye have the things ye ask, and ye shall receive them; I will answer you.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="GH 5-28-1902">The Gospel Herald, May 28, 1902</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[73]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-noindent"><strong>Earnest, fervent prayer is needed, not feeble, heartless prayers</strong>—There is need of prayer,—most earnest, fervent, agonizing prayer,—such prayer as David offered when he exclaimed: “As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after Thee, O God.”“I have longed after Thy precepts;”“I have longed for Thy salvation.”“My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.”“My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto Thy judgments.” This is the spirit of wrestling prayer, such as was possessed by the royal psalmist.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Daniel prayed to God, not exalting himself or claiming any goodness: “O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for Thine own sake, O my God.” This is what James calls the effectual, fervent prayer. Of Christ it is said: “And being in an agony He prayed more earnestly.” In what contrast to this intercession by the Majesty of heaven are the feeble, heartless prayers that are offered to God. Many are content with lip service, and but few have a sincere, earnest, affectionate longing after God.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="4T 534.1">Testimonies for the Church 4:534</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prevailing prayer does not have to include tears and struggles</strong>—There are many souls who wrestle for special victories and special blessings that they may do some great thing. To this end they are always feeling that they must make an agonizing struggle in prayer and tears. When these persons search the Scriptures with prayer to know the expressed will of God, and then do His will from the heart without one reservation or self-indulgence, they will find rest. All the agonizing, all the tears and struggles, will not bring them the blessing they long for. Self must be entirely surrendered. They must do the work that presents itself, appropriating the abundance of the grace of God which is promised to all who ask in faith.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="9T 165.1">Testimonies for the Church 9:165</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Fervent, constant prayer is a necessity</strong>—If the Saviour of men, the Son of God, felt the need of prayer, how much more should feeble, sinful mortals feel the necessity of fervent, constant prayer. <span class="pagebreak">[74]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-noindent">Our heavenly Father waits to bestow upon us the fullness of His blessing. It is our privilege to drink largely at the fountain of boundless love. What a wonder it is that we pray so little! God is ready and willing to hear the sincere prayer of the humblest of His children, and yet there is much manifest reluctance on our part to make known our wants to God. What can the angels of heaven think of poor helpless human beings, who are subject to temptation, when God’s heart of infinite love yearns toward them, ready to give them more than they can ask or think, and yet they pray so little and have so little faith? The angels love to bow before God; they love to be near Him. They regard communion with God as their highest joy; and yet the children of earth, who need so much the help that God only can give, seem satisfied to walk without the light of His Spirit, the companionship of His presence.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">The darkness of the evil one encloses those who neglect to pray. The whispered temptations of the enemy entice them to sin; and it is all because they do not make use of the privileges that God has given them in the divine appointment of prayer. Why should the sons and daughters of God be reluctant to pray, when prayer is the key in the hand of faith to unlock heaven’s storehouse, where are treasured the boundless resources of Omnipotence? Without unceasing prayer and diligent watching we are in danger of growing careless and of deviating from the right path. The adversary seeks continually to obstruct the way to the mercy seat, that we may not by earnest supplication and faith obtain grace and power to resist temptation. (<span class="egw-eng" title="SC 94.2">Steps to Christ, 94</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Like jacob, wrestle in prayer</strong>—Be in earnest, be sincere. Fervent prayer availeth much. Jacob-like, wrestle in prayer. Agonize. Jesus, in the garden, sweat great drops of blood; you must make an effort. Do not leave your closet until you feel strong in God; then watch, and just as long as you watch and pray you can keep these evil besetments under, and the grace of God can and will appear in you.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="1T 158.1">Testimonies for the Church 1:158</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[75]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-noindent">Jacob prevailed because he was persevering and determined. His experience testifies to the power of importunate prayer. It is now that we are to learn this lesson of prevailing prayer, of unyielding faith. The greatest victories to the church of Christ or to the individual Christian are not those that are gained by talent or education, by wealth or the favor of men. They are those victories that are gained in the audience chamber with God, when earnest, agonizing faith lays hold upon the mighty arm of power.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Those who are unwilling to forsake every sin and to seek earnestly for God’s blessing, will not obtain it. But all who will lay hold of God’s promises as did Jacob, and be as earnest and persevering as he was, will succeed as he succeeded.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="PP 203.1">Patriarchs and Prophets, 203</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Wrestle in prayer until victory comes</strong>—God will be to us everything we will let Him be. Our languid, half-hearted prayers will not bring us returns from heaven. Oh, we need to press our petitions! Ask in faith, wait in faith, receive in faith, rejoice in hope, for everyone that seeketh findeth. Be in earnest in the matter. Seek God with all the heart. People put soul and earnestness into everything they undertake in temporal things, until their efforts are crowned with success. With intense earnestness learn the trade of seeking the rich blessings that God has promised, and with persevering, determined effort you shall have His light and His truth and His rich grace.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">In sincerity, in soul hunger, cry after God. Wrestle with the heavenly agencies until you have the victory. Put your whole being into the Lord’s hands, soul, body, and spirit, and resolve to be His loving, consecrated agency, moved by His will, controlled by His mind, infused by His Spirit.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Tell Jesus your wants in the sincerity of your soul. You are not required to hold a long controversy with, or preach a sermon to, God, but with a heart of sorrow for your sins, say, “Save me, Lord, or I perish.” There is hope for such souls. They will seek, they will ask, they will knock, and they will find. When Jesus has taken away the burden of sin that is crushing the soul, you will experience the blessedness of the peace of Christ.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="OHC 131.1">Our High Calling, 131</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[76]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-noindent"><strong>Pray without ceasing</strong>—In the work of heart-keeping we must be instant in prayer, unwearied in petitioning the throne of grace for assistance. Those who take the name of Christian should come to God in earnestness and humility, pleading for help. The Saviour has told us to pray without ceasing. The Christian can not always be in the position of prayer, but his thoughts and desires can always be upward. Our self-confidence would vanish, did we talk less and pray more.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="SD 99.1">Sons and Daughters of God, 99</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Every breath should be a prayer</strong>—The reason why so many are left to themselves in places of temptation is that they do not set the Lord always before them. When we permit our communion with God to be broken, our defense is departed from us. Not all your good purposes and good intentions will enable you to withstand evil. You must be men and women of prayer. Your petitions must not be faint, occasional, and fitful, but earnest, persevering, and constant. It is not always necessary to bow upon your knees in order to pray. Cultivate the habit of talking with the Saviour when you are alone, when you are walking, and when you are busy with your daily labor. Let the heart be continually uplifted in silent petition for help, for light, for strength, for knowledge. Let every breath be a prayer.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MH 510.1">The Ministry of Healing, 510, 511</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Pray with unshaken faith</strong>—Pray, yes, pray with unshaken faith and trust. The Angel of the covenant, even our Lord Jesus Christ, is the Mediator who secures the acceptance of the prayers of His believing ones.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="8T 179.1">Testimonies for the Church 8:179</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Come boldly in prayer</strong>—Why not pray as if you had a conscience void of offense, and could come to the throne of grace in humility, yet with holy boldness, lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting? Do not bow down and cover up your faces as if there were something that you desired to conceal; but lift up your eyes toward the heavenly sanctuary, where Christ your Mediator stands before the Father to present your prayers, mingled <span class="pagebreak">[77]</span> with His own merit and spotless righteousness, as fragrant incense.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">You are invited to come, to ask, to seek, to knock; and you are assured that you will not come in vain. Jesus says, “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: for everyone that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Matthew 7:7">Matthew 7:7, 8</span>.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="CT 241.1">Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 241, 242</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Fervent prayer ascends as a fragrant influence</strong>—They have willingly endured hardship and privation, and have watched and prayed for the success of the cause. Their gifts and sacrifices express the fervent gratitude and praise of their hearts to Him who has called them out of darkness into His marvelous light. No more fragrant influence can ascend to heaven. Their prayers and their alms come up as a memorial before God.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="2SM 212.1">Selected Messages 2:212</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Two lovely cherubs, one on each end of the ark, stood with their wings outstretched above it, and touching each other above the head of Jesus as He stood before the mercy seat. Their faces were turned toward each other, and they looked downward to the ark, representing all the angelic host looking with interest at the law of God. Between the cherubim was a golden censer, and as the prayers of the saints, offered in faith, came up to Jesus, and He presented them to His Father, a cloud of fragrance arose from the incense, looking like smoke of most beautiful colors. Above the place where Jesus stood, before the ark, was exceedingly bright glory that I could not look upon; it appeared like the throne of God. As the incense ascended to the Father, the excellent glory came from the throne to Jesus, and from Him it was shed upon those whose prayers had come up like sweet incense. Light poured upon Jesus in rich abundance and overshadowed the mercy seat, and the train of glory filled the temple. I could not long look upon the surpassing brightness. No language can describe it. I was overwhelmed and turned from the majesty and glory of the scene.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="EW 252.1">Early Writings, 252</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[78]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>We are to imitate Christ’s example of importunate prayer</strong>—The strength of Christ was in prayer. He had taken humanity, and He bore our infirmities and became sin for us. Christ retired to the groves or mountains with the world and everything else shut out. He was alone with His Father. With intense earnestness, He poured out His supplications, and put forth all the strength of His soul in grasping the hand of the Infinite. When new and great trials were before Him, He would steal away to the solitude of the mountains, and pass the entire night in prayer to His Heavenly Father.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">As Christ is our example in all things, if we imitate His example in earnest, importunate prayer to God that we may have strength in His name who never yielded to the temptations of Satan to resist the devices of the wily foe, we shall not be overcome by him.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="YI 4-1-1873">The Youth’s Instructor, April 1, 1873</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Persevering effort and prayer prepare us for daily duties</strong>—Those who seek God in secret telling the Lord their needs and pleading for help, will not plead in vain. “Thy Father which seeth in secret Himself shall reward thee openly.” As we make Christ our daily companion we shall feel that the powers of an unseen world are all around us; and by looking unto Jesus we shall become assimilated to His image. By beholding we become changed. The character is softened, refined, and ennobled for the heavenly kingdom. The sure result of our intercourse and fellowship with our Lord will be to increase piety, purity, and fervor. There will be a growing intelligence in prayer. We are receiving a divine education, and this is illustrated in a life of diligence and zeal.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">The soul that turns to God for its help, its support, its power, by daily, earnest prayer, will have noble aspirations, clear perceptions of truth and duty, lofty purposes of action, and a continual hungering and thirsting after righteousness. By maintaining a connection with God, we shall be enabled to diffuse to others, through our association with them, the light, the peace, the serenity, that rule in our hearts. The strength acquired in prayer to God, united with persevering effort in training the mind in thoughtfulness and caretaking, prepares <span class="pagebreak">[79]</span> one for daily duties and keeps the spirit in peace under all circumstances.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MB 85.1">Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing, 85</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Nothing to divert us from Bible study and earnest prayer</strong>—Let nothing, however dear, however loved, absorb your mind and affections, diverting you from the study of God’s word or from earnest prayer. Watch unto prayer. Live your own requests.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="8T 53.1">Testimonies for the Church 8:53</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prevailing prayer includes faith</strong>—Another element of prevailing prayer is faith. “He that cometh to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Hebrews 11:6">Hebrews 11:6</span>. Jesus said to His disciples, “What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Mark 11:24">Mark 11:24</span>.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="SC 96.1">Steps to Christ, 96</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Faith is an essential element of prevailing prayer. “He that cometh to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.”“If we ask anything according to His will, He heareth us: and if we know that He hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of Him.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Hebrews 11:6">Hebrews 11:6</span>; <span class="bible-kjv" title="1 John 5:14">1 John 5:14, 15</span>. With the persevering faith of Jacob, with the unyielding persistence of Elijah, we may present our petitions to the Father, claiming all that He has promised. The honor of His throne is staked for the fulfillment of His word.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="PK 157.1">Prophets and Kings, 157, 158</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer gives evidence of our confidence in God</strong>—The Lord says, “Call upon Me in the day of trouble.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Psalm 50:15">Psalm 50:15</span>. He invites us to present to Him our perplexities and necessities, and our need of divine help. He bids us be instant in prayer. As soon as difficulties arise, we are to offer to Him our sincere, earnest petitions. By our importunate prayers we give evidence of our strong confidence in God. The sense of our need leads us to pray earnestly, and our heavenly Father is moved by our supplications.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="COL 172.2">Christ’s Object Lessons, 172</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[80]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>God answers earnest prayers</strong>—It is only as we ask in earnest prayer, that God will grant us our heart’s desire.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="GW 255.1">Gospel Workers, 255</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>After praying, continue to claim the promise</strong>—After the prayer is made, if the answer is not realized immediately, do not weary of waiting and become unstable. Waver not. Cling to the promise, “Faithful is He that calleth you, who also will do it.” Like the importunate widow, urge your case, being firm in your purpose. Is the object important and of great consequence to you? It certainly is. Then waver not, for your faith may be tried. If the thing you desire is valuable, it is worthy of a strong, earnest effort. You have the promise; watch and pray. Be steadfast and the prayer will be answered; for is it not God who has promised? If it costs you something to obtain it you will prize it the more when obtained. You are plainly told that if you waver you need not think that you shall receive anything of the Lord. A caution is here given not to become weary, but to rest firmly upon the promise. If you ask, He will give you liberally and upbraid not.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="2T 131.1">Testimonies for the Church 2:131</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>God will not turn us away empty</strong>—When temptations and trials rush in upon us, let us go to God and agonize with Him in prayer. He will not turn us away empty, but will give us grace and strength to overcome, and to break the power of the enemy.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="EW 46.1">Early Writings, 46</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer without living faith avails nothing</strong>—Faith is not feeling. “Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” [<span class="bible-kjv" title="Hebrews 11:1">Hebrews 11:1</span>.] True faith is in no sense allied to presumption. Only he who has true faith is secure against presumption, for presumption is Satan’s counterfeit of faith.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Faith claims God’s promises and brings forth fruit in obedience. Presumption also claims the promises, but uses them as Satan did, to excuse transgression. Faith would have led our first <span class="pagebreak">[81]</span> parents to trust the love of God and to obey His commands. Presumption led them to transgress His law, believing that His great love would save them from the consequences of their sin. It is not faith that claims the favor of Heaven without complying with the conditions on which mercy is to be granted. Genuine faith has its foundation in the promises and provisions of the Scriptures.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">To talk of religion in a casual way, to pray without soul-hunger and living faith, avails nothing. A nominal faith in Christ, which accepts Him merely as the Saviour of the world, can never bring healing to the soul. The faith that is unto salvation is not a mere intellectual assent to the truth. He who waits for entire knowledge before he will exercise faith, cannot receive blessing from God.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">It is not enough to believe about Christ; we must believe in Him. The only faith that will benefit us is that which embraces Him as a personal Saviour; which appropriates His merits to ourselves. Many hold faith as an opinion. But saving faith is a transaction, by which those who receive Christ join themselves in covenant relation with God. Genuine faith is life. A living faith means an increase of vigor, a confiding trust, by which the soul becomes a conquering power.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="GW 260.1">Gospel Workers, 260, 261</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer will prevail against Satan</strong>—The prayer of faith is the great strength of the Christian and will assuredly prevail against Satan. This is why he insinuates that we have no need of prayer. The name of Jesus, our Advocate, he detests; and when we earnestly come to Him for help, Satan’s host is alarmed. It serves his purpose well if we neglect the exercise of prayer, for then his lying wonders are more readily received.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="1T 296.1">Testimonies for the Church 1:296</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer brings the greatest victories</strong>—The greatest victories gained for the cause of God are not the result of labored argument, ample facilities, wide influence, or abundance of means; they are gained in the audience chamber with God, when with earnest, agonizing faith men lay hold upon the mighty arm of power.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="GW 259.1">Gospel Workers, 259</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[82]</span> </p>
