	<h2 class="chapterhead">Chapter 18—Prayer and Worship</h2>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer and worship are essential to spiritual growth</strong>—Seek every opportunity to go where prayer is wont to be made. Those who are really seeking for communion with God will be seen in the prayer meeting, faithful to do their duty and earnest and anxious to reap all the benefits they can gain. They will improve every opportunity of placing themselves where they can receive the rays of light from heaven.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="SC 98.1">Steps to Christ, 98</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Private prayer, family prayer, prayer in public gatherings for the worship of God—all are essential. And we are to live our prayers. We are to co-operate with Christ in His work.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="7T 239.1">Testimonies for the Church 7:239</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">In our devotional meetings, our voices should express by prayer and praise our adoration of the heavenly Father, that all may know that we worship God in simplicity and truth, and in the beauty of holiness.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="CT 245.1">Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 245</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Let small companies assemble in the evening, at noon, or in the <span class="pagebreak">[199]</span> early morning to study the Bible. Let them have a season of prayer, that they may be strengthened, enlightened, and sanctified by the Holy Spirit. This work Christ wants to have done in the heart of every worker. If you yourselves will open the door to receive it, a great blessing will come to you. Angels of God will be in your assembly. You will feed upon the leaves of the tree of life. What testimonies you may bear of the loving acquaintance made with your fellow workers in these precious seasons when seeking the blessing of God. Let each tell his experience in simple words. This will bring more comfort and joy to the soul than all the pleasant instruments of music that could be brought into the churches. Christ will come into your hearts. It is by this means only that you can maintain your integrity.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="7T 195.1">Testimonies for the Church 7:195</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Prepare for eternity with such zeal as you have not yet manifested. Educate your mind to love the Bible, to love the prayer meeting, to love the hour of meditation, and, above all, the hour when the soul communes with God. Become heavenly-minded if you would unite with the heavenly choir in the mansions above.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="2T 267.1">Testimonies for the Church 2:267</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">When the Spirit of God shall work upon the heart, cleansing the soul-temple of its defilement of worldliness and pleasure-loving, all will be seen in the prayer meeting, faithful to do their duty and earnest and anxious to reap all the benefit they can gain. The faithful worker for the Master will improve every opportunity to place himself directly under the rays of light from the throne of God, and this light will be reflected upon others.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="4T 461.1">Testimonies for the Church 4:461</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>God’s presence makes times of prayer and public worship sacred</strong>—True reverence for God is inspired by a sense of His infinite greatness and a realization of His presence. With this sense of the Unseen the heart of every child should be deeply impressed. The hour and place of prayer and the services of public worship <span class="pagebreak">[200]</span> the child should be taught to regard as sacred because God is there. And as reverence is manifested in attitude and demeanor, the feeling that inspires it will be deepened.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="Ed 242.1">Education, 242, 243</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Public prayer brings us into God’s presence</strong>—Prayer, whether offered in the public assembly, at the family altar, or in secret, places man directly in the presence of God. By constant prayer the youth may obtain principles so firm that the most powerful temptations will not draw them from their allegiance to God.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="ML 18.1">My Life Today, 18</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Public prayers should not be long and dry</strong>—As children of the heavenly King, you should educate yourselves to bear testimony in a clear, distinct voice, and in such a manner that no one may have the impression that you are reluctant to speak of the mercies of the Lord. In social meeting, prayer should be offered so that all may be edified, and those who take part in this exercise should follow the example given us in the Lord’s beautiful prayer for the world. The prayer of Jesus is simple, clear, comprehensive, and yet not long and spiritless as are the dry prayers that are often offered in public. These spiritless prayers better not be uttered; for they fail to bless or edify, and are a mere form without vital power.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="CE 129.1">Christian Education, 129</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">The prayers offered in public should be short and to the point. God does not require us to make the season of worship tedious by lengthy petitions.... A few minutes is long enough for any ordinary public petition.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="Ev 146.1">Evangelism, 146</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Our prayer and social meetings should be seasons of special help and encouragement. Each one has a work to do to make these gatherings as interesting and profitable as possible. This can best be done by having a fresh experience daily in the things of God, and by not hesitating to speak of His love in the assemblies of His people. If you allow no darkness or unbelief to enter your hearts, they will not be manifest in your meetings. <span class="pagebreak">[201]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-noindent">Our meetings should be made intensely interesting. They should be pervaded with the very atmosphere of heaven. Let there be no long, dry speeches and formal prayers, merely for the sake of occupying the time.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="ChS 211.1">Christian Service, 211</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">At family worship let the children take a part. Let all bring their Bibles and each read a verse or two. Then let some familiar hymn be sung, followed by prayer. For this, Christ has given a model. The Lord’s Prayer was not intended to be repeated merely as a form, but it is an illustration of what our prayers should be—simple, earnest, and comprehensive. In a simple petition tell the Lord your needs and express gratitude for His mercies. Thus you invite Jesus as a welcome guest into your home and heart. In the family long prayers concerning remote objects are not in place. They make the hour of prayer a weariness, when it should be regarded as a privilege and blessing. Make the season one of interest and joy.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="CG 524.1">Child Guidance, 524</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Long, prosy talks and prayers are out of place anywhere, and especially in the social meeting. They weary the angels as well as the people who listen to them. Our prayers should be short, and right to the point. Let the Spirit of God pervade the hearts of the worshipers, and it will sweep away all formality and dullness.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="RH 10-10-1882">The Review and Herald, October 10, 1882</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">One or two minutes is long enough for any ordinary prayer.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="2T 581.1">Testimonies for the Church 2:581</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Long prayers make worship wearisome</strong>—In every family there should be a fixed time for morning and evening worship. How appropriate it is for parents to gather their children about them before the fast is broken, to thank the heavenly Father for His protection during the night, and to ask Him for His help and guidance and watchcare during the day! How fitting, also, when evening comes, for parents and children to gather once more before Him and thank Him for the blessings of the day that is past! <span class="pagebreak">[202]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-noindent">The father, or, in his absence, the mother, should conduct the worship, selecting a portion of Scripture that is interesting and easily understood. The service should be short. When a long chapter is read and a long prayer offered, the service is made wearisome, and at its close a sense of relief is felt. God is dishonored when the hour of worship is made dry and irksome, when it is so tedious, so lacking in interest, that the children dread it.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Fathers and mothers, make the hour of worship intensely interesting. There is no reason why this hour should not be the most pleasant and enjoyable of the day. A little thought given to preparation for it will enable you to make it full of interest and profit. From time to time let the service be varied. Questions may be asked on the portion of Scripture read, and a few earnest, timely remarks may be made. A song of praise may be sung. The prayer offered should be short and pointed. In simple, earnest words let the one who leads in prayer praise God for His goodness and ask Him for help. As circumstances permit, let the children join in the reading and the prayer.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Eternity alone will reveal the good with which such seasons of worship are fraught.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="7T 43.1">Testimonies for the Church 7:43, 44</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Our prayers in public should be short, and express only the real wants of the soul, asking in simplicity and simple trusting faith for the very things we need. Prayer from the humble, contrite heart is the vital breath of the soul hungering for righteousness.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="ST 12-3-1896">The Signs of the Times, December 3, 1896</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">From the light I have had upon the subject I have decided that God does not require us, as we assemble for His worship, to make these seasons tedious and wearisome by remaining bowed quite a length of time, listening to several long prayers. Those in feeble health cannot endure this taxation without extreme weariness and exhaustion. The body becomes weary by remaining bowed down so long; and what is worse still, the mind becomes so wearied by the continuous exercise of prayer that no spiritual refreshment is realized, and the meeting is to them worse than a loss. <span class="pagebreak">[203]</span> They have become wearied mentally and physically, and they have obtained no spiritual strength.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Meetings for conference and prayer should not be made tedious. If possible, all should be prompt to the hour appointed; and if there are dilatory ones, who are half an hour or even fifteen minutes behind the time, there should be no waiting. If there are but two present, they can claim the promise.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">The meeting should open at the appointed hour if possible, be there few or many present. Formality and cold stiffness should be laid aside, and all should be prompt to duty. Upon common occasions there should not be prayer of more than ten minutes’ duration. After there has been a change of position, and the exercise of singing or exhortation has relieved the sameness, then, if any feel the burden of prayer, let them pray.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">All should feel it a Christian duty to pray short. Tell the Lord just what you want, without going all over the world. In private prayer all have the privilege of praying as long as they desire and of being as explicit as they please. They can pray for all their relatives and friends. The closet is the place to tell all their private difficulties, and trials, and temptations. A common meeting to worship God is not the place to open the privacies of the heart.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">What is the object of assembling together? Is it to inform God, to instruct Him by telling Him all we know in prayer? We meet together to edify one another by an interchange of thoughts and feelings, to gather strength, and light, and courage by becoming acquainted with one another’s hopes and aspirations; and by our earnest, heartfelt prayers, offered up in faith, we receive refreshment and vigor from the Source of our strength. These meetings should be most precious seasons and should be made interesting to all who have any relish for religious things.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">There are some, I fear, who do not take their troubles to God in private prayer, but reserve them for the prayer meeting, and there do up their praying for several days. Such may be named conference and prayer meeting killers. They emit no light; they edify no one. Their cold, frozen prayers and long, backslidden testimonies cast a <span class="pagebreak">[204]</span> shadow. All are glad when they get through, and it is almost impossible to throw off the chill and darkness which their prayers and exhortations bring into the meeting. From the light which I have received, our meetings should be spiritual and social, and not too long. Reserve, pride, vanity, and fear of man should be left at home. Little differences and prejudices should not be taken with us to these meetings. As in a united family, simplicity, meekness, confidence, and love should exist in the hearts of brethren and sisters who meet to be refreshed and invigorated by bringing their lights together.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="2T 577.1">Testimonies for the Church 2:577-579</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Public prayers should be spoken distinctly and clearly</strong>—Let those who pray and those who speak pronounce their words properly and speak in clear, distinct, even tones. Prayer, if properly offered, is a power for good. It is one of the means used by the Lord to communicate to the people the precious treasures of truth. But prayer is not what it should be, because of the defective voices of those who utter it. Satan rejoices when the prayers offered to God are almost inaudible. Let God’s people learn how to speak and pray in a way that will properly represent the great truths they possess. Let the testimonies borne and the prayers offered be clear and distinct. Thus God will be glorified.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="6T 382.1">Testimonies for the Church 6:382</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Use simple language when praying publicly</strong>—High-flown language is inappropriate in prayer, whether the petition be offered in the pulpit, in the family circle, or in secret. Especially should the one offering public prayer use simple language, that others may understand what is said and unite with the petition.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">It is the heart-felt prayer of faith that is heard in heaven and answered on earth.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="GW 177.1">Gospel Workers, 177</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Our prayers should be orderly</strong>—I have seen that confusion is displeasing to the Lord, and that there should be order in praying and also in singing. We should not come to the house of God to pray for our families unless deep feeling shall lead us while the Spirit of God is <span class="pagebreak">[205]</span> convicting them. Generally, the proper place to pray for our families is at the family altar. When the subjects of our prayers are at a distance, the closet is the proper place to plead with God for them. When in the house of God, we should pray for a present blessing and should expect God to hear and answer our prayers. Such meetings will be lively and interesting.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="1T 145.1">Testimonies for the Church 1:145, 146</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>God should be approached with reverence in prayer</strong>—Some think it a mark of humility to pray to God in a common manner, as if talking with a human being. They profane His name by needlessly and irreverently mingling with their prayers the words, “God Almighty,” awful, sacred words, which should never pass the lips except in subdued tones and with a feeling of awe.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="GW 176.1">Gospel Workers, 176</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-noindent"><strong>It is our privilege to kneel when praying publicly</strong>—Both in public and private worship it is our duty to bow down upon our knees before God when we offer our petitions to Him. This act shows our dependence upon God.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="2SM 312.1">Selected Messages 2:312</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">According to the light that has been given me, it would be pleasing to God for ministers to bow down as soon as they step into the pulpit, and solemnly ask help from God. What impression would that make? There would be solemnity and awe upon the people. Their minister is communing with God; he is committing himself to God before he dares to stand before the people. Solemnity rests upon the people, and angels of God are brought very near. Ministers should look to God the first thing as they come into the desk, thus saying to all: God is the source of my strength.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="2T 612.1">Testimonies for the Church 2:612</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">When the minister enters, it should be with dignified, solemn mien. He should bow down in silent prayer as soon as he steps into the pulpit, and earnestly ask help of God. What an impression this will make! There will be solemnity and awe upon the people. Their <span class="pagebreak">[206]</span> minister is communing with God; he is committing himself to God before he dares to stand before the people. Solemnity rests upon all, and angels of God are brought very near. Every one of the congregation, also, who fears God should with bowed head unite in silent prayer with him that God may grace the meeting with His presence and give power to His truth proclaimed from human lips. When the meeting is opened by prayer, every knee should bow in the presence of the Holy One, and every heart should ascend to God in silent devotion. The prayers of faithful worshipers will be heard, and the ministry of the word will prove effectual. The lifeless attitude of the worshipers in the house of God is one great reason why the ministry is not more productive of good. The melody of song, poured forth from many hearts in clear, distinct utterance, is one of God’s instrumentalities in the work of saving souls. All the service should be conducted with solemnity and awe, as if in the visible presence of the Master of assemblies.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="5T 492.1">Testimonies for the Church 5:492, 493</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Both in public and in private worship it is our privilege to bow on our knees before God when we offer our petitions to Him. Jesus, our example, “kneeled down, and prayed.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Luke 22:41">Luke 22:41</span>. Of His disciples it is recorded that they, too, “kneeled down, and prayed.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Acts 9:40">Acts 9:40</span>. Paul declared, “I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Ephesians 3:14">Ephesians 3:14</span>. In confessing before God the sins of Israel, Ezra knelt. See <span class="bible-kjv" title="Ezra 9:5">Ezra 9:5</span>. Daniel “kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Daniel 6:10">Daniel 6:10</span>.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="PK 48.1">Prophets and Kings, 48</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Public prayer is important but not sufficient by itself</strong>—Family or public prayer alone is not sufficient. Secret prayer is very important; in solitude the soul is laid bare to the inspecting eye of God, and every motive is scrutinized. Secret prayer! How precious! The soul communing with God! Secret prayer is to be heard only by the prayer-hearing God. No curious ear is to receive the burden of such petitions.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="2T 189.1">Testimonies for the Church 2:189, 190</span>). <span class="pagebreak">[207]</span> </p>
