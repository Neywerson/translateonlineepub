	<h2 class="chapterhead">Chapter 10—Reasons to Pray</h2>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Enlightens the mind regarding what is truth</strong>—Why is it that we do not receive more from Him who is the source of light and power? We expect too little. Has God lost His love for man? Is not this love still flowing earthward? Has He lost His desire to show Himself strong in behalf of His people? Christ will give us victory in the conflict. Who can doubt this when we know that He laid aside His royal robe and kingly crown, and came to this world in the garb of humanity, that He might stand as man’s substitute and surety?</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">We do not value as we should the power and efficacy of prayer. “The Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which can not be uttered.” God desires us to come to Him in prayer, that He may enlighten our minds. He alone can give clear conceptions of truth. He alone can soften and subdue the heart. He can quicken the understanding to discern truth from error. He can establish the wavering mind, and give it a knowledge and a faith that will endure the test. Pray then; pray without ceasing. The Lord who heard Daniel’s prayer, will hear yours if you will approach Him as Daniel did.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="RH 3-24-1904">The Review and Herald, March 24, 1904</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[91]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Acquaints us with the father</strong>—Oh, do we know God as we should? What comfort, what joy, we should have if we were to learn daily the lessons He desires us to learn! We must know Him by an experimental knowledge. It will be profitable for us to spend more time in secret prayer, in becoming personally acquainted with our heavenly Father.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MM 102.1">Medical Ministry, 102</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Unites us with each other and with God</strong>—Prayer unites us with one another and with God. Prayer brings Jesus to our side, and gives to the fainting, perplexed soul new strength to overcome the world, the flesh, and the devil. Prayer turns aside the attacks of Satan.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="COL 250.1">Christ’s Object Lessons, 250</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Enables us to resist temptation</strong>—Why should the sons and daughters of God be reluctant to pray, when prayer is the key in the hand of faith to unlock heaven’s storehouse, where are treasured the boundless resources of Omnipotence? Without unceasing prayer and diligent watching we are in danger of growing careless and of deviating from the right path. The adversary seeks continually to obstruct the way to the mercy seat, that we may not by earnest supplication and faith obtain grace and power to resist temptation.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="SC 94.1">Steps to Christ, 94, 95</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Christ is our only hope. Come to God in the name of Him who gave His life for the life of the world. Rely upon the efficacy of His sacrifice. Show that His love, His joy, is in your soul, and that because of this, your joy is full. In God is our strength. Pray much. Prayer is the life of the soul. The prayer of faith is the weapon by which we may successfully resist every assault of the enemy.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="1SM 88.1">Selected Messages 1:88</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prepares us for membership in the church above</strong>—To the humble, believing soul, the house of God on earth is the gate of heaven. The song of praise, the prayer, the words spoken by Christ’s representatives, are God’s appointed agencies to prepare a people for the church above, for that loftier worship into which there can enter nothing that defileth.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="5T 491.1">Testimonies for the Church 5:491</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[92]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Reinforces our convictions</strong>—Our convictions need daily to be reinforced by humble, sincere prayer and reading of the word. While we each have an individuality, while we each should hold our convictions firmly, we must hold them as God’s truth and in the strength which God imparts. If we do not, they will be wrung from our grasp.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="6T 401.1">Testimonies for the Church 6:401</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Supplies temporal necessities</strong>—Every promise in the word of God furnishes us with subject matter for prayer, presenting the pledged word of Jehovah as our assurance. Whatever spiritual blessing we need, it is our privilege to claim through Jesus. We may tell the Lord, with the simplicity of a child, exactly what we need. We may state to Him our temporal matters, asking Him for bread and raiment as well as for the bread of life and the robe of Christ’s righteousness. Your heavenly Father knows that you have need of all these things, and you are invited to ask Him concerning them. It is through the name of Jesus that every favor is received. God will honor that name, and will supply your necessities from the riches of His liberality.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MB 133.1">Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing, 133</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Every soul has the privilege of stating to the Lord his own special necessities and to offer his individual thanksgiving for the blessings that he daily receives.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="9T 278.1">Testimonies for the Church 9:278, 279</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Does not provide new information to God</strong>—Prayer is not understood as it should be. Our prayers are not to inform God of something He does not know. The Lord is acquainted with the secrets of every soul. Our prayers need not be long and loud. God reads the hidden thoughts. We may pray in secret, and He who sees in secret will hear, and will reward us openly.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MYP 247.1">Messages to Young People, 247</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Daily supplies of grace given</strong>—Those who at Pentecost were endued with power from on high, were not thereby freed from further temptation and trial. As they witnessed for truth and righteousness they were repeatedly assailed by the enemy of all truth, who <span class="pagebreak">[93]</span> sought to rob them of their Christian experience. They were compelled to strive with all their God-given powers to reach the measure of the stature of men and women in Christ Jesus. Daily they prayed for fresh supplies of grace, that they might reach higher and still higher toward perfection. Under the Holy Spirit’s working even the weakest, by exercising faith in God, learned to improve their entrusted powers and to become sanctified, refined, and ennobled. As in humility they submitted to the molding influence of the Holy Spirit, they received of the fullness of the Godhead and were fashioned in the likeness of the divine.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="AA 49.1">The Acts of the Apostles, 49, 50</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Wisdom supplied</strong>—We must seek wisdom from on high that we may stand in this day of error and delusion.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="EW 87.1">Early Writings, 87, 88</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Pray most earnestly for an understanding of the times in which we live, for a fuller conception of His purpose, and for increased efficiency in soulsaving.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="2SM 399.1">Selected Messages 2:399</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>The baptism of the holy spirit given</strong>—God’s faithful messengers are to seek to carry forward the Lord’s work in His appointed way. They are to place themselves in close connection with the Great Teacher, that they may be daily taught of God. They are to wrestle with God in earnest prayer for a baptism of the Holy Spirit that they may meet the needs of a world perishing in sin. All power is promised those who go forth in faith to proclaim the everlasting gospel. As the servants of God bear to the world a living message fresh from the throne of glory, the light of truth will shine forth as a lamp that burneth, reaching to all parts of the world. Thus the darkness of error and unbelief will be dispelled from the minds of the honest in heart in all lands, who are now seeking after God, “If haply they might feel after Him, and find Him.”—(<span class="egw-eng" title="TM 459.1">Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, 459, 460</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Today’s needs provided for</strong>—The truth of God received into the heart is able to make you wise unto salvation. In believing <span class="pagebreak">[94]</span> and obeying it you will receive grace sufficient for the duties and trials of today. Grace for tomorrow you do not need. You should feel that you have only to do with today. Overcome for today; deny self for today; watch and pray for today; obtain victories in God for today.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="3T 333.1">Testimonies for the Church 3:333</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>The needs of God’s work cared for</strong>—The varied interests of the cause furnish us with food for reflection and inspiration for our prayers.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="4T 459.1">Testimonies for the Church 4:459</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Answered prayers are cause for praise and thanksgiving</strong>—In the second chapter of 1 Samuel is recorded the prayer of a consecrated woman who served and glorified God. She prayed: “My heart rejoiceth in the Lord, mine horn is exalted in the Lord: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation. There is none holy as the Lord: for there is none beside thee: neither is there any rock like our God.” Hannah’s offering of thanksgiving for the answer to her prayer is a lesson to those who today receive answers to their requests. Do we not neglect to return praise and thanksgiving to God for His lovingkindness?</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">David declares, “I love the Lord, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications. Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.” God’s goodness in hearing and answering prayer places us under heavy obligation to express our thanksgiving for the favors bestowed upon us. We should praise God much more than we do. The blessings received in answer to prayer should be promptly acknowledged. The record of them should be placed in our diary, that when we take the book in hand, we may remember the goodness of the Lord, and praise His holy name.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="RH 5-7-1908">The Review and Herald, May 7, 1908</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Our characters may be transformed</strong>—The change we need is a change of heart, and can only be obtained by seeking God individually for His blessing, by pleading with Him for His power, by fervently praying that His grace may come upon us, and that our characters <span class="pagebreak">[95]</span> may be transformed. This is the change we need today, and for the attainment of this experience we should exercise persevering energy and manifest heartfelt earnestness. We should ask with true sincerity, “What shall I do to be saved?” We should know just what steps we are taking heavenward.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="1SM 187.1">Selected Messages 1:187</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Our understanding of God’s word expanded</strong>—No man is safe for a day or an hour without prayer. Especially should we entreat the Lord for wisdom to understand His word. Here are revealed the wiles of the tempter and the means by which he may be successfully resisted. Satan is an expert in quoting Scripture, placing his own interpretation upon passages, by which he hopes to cause us to stumble. We should study the Bible with humility of heart, never losing sight of our dependence upon God. While we must constantly guard against the devices of Satan, we should pray in faith continually: “Lead us not into temptation.”(<span class="egw-eng" title="GC 530.1">The Great Controversy, 530</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">The Bible should never be studied without prayer. The Holy Spirit alone can cause us to feel the importance of those things easy to be understood, or prevent us from wresting truths difficult of comprehension. It is the office of heavenly angels to prepare the heart so to comprehend God’s word that we shall be charmed with its beauty, admonished by its warnings, or animated and strengthened by its promises. We should make the psalmist’s petition our own: “Open Thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of Thy law.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Psalm 119:18">Psalm 119:18</span>. Temptations often appear irresistible because, through neglect of prayer and the study of the Bible, the tempted one cannot readily remember God’s promises and meet Satan with the Scripture weapons. But angels are round about those who are willing to be taught in divine things; and in the time of great necessity they will bring to their remembrance the very truths which are needed. Thus “when the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Isaiah 59:19">Isaiah 59:19</span>—(<span class="egw-eng" title="GC 599.1">The Great Controversy, 599, 600</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[96]</span> </p>
