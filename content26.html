	<h2 class="chapterhead">Chapter 26—Counterfeit Prayers</h2>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Do not approach God lightly in prayer</strong>—Humility and reverence should characterize the deportment of all who come into the presence of God. In the name of Jesus we may come before Him with confidence, but we must not approach Him with the boldness of presumption, as though He were on a level with ourselves. There are those who address the great and all-powerful and holy God, who dwelleth in light unapproachable, as they would address an equal, or even an inferior. There are those who conduct themselves in His house as they would not presume to do in the audience chamber of an earthly ruler. These should remember that they are in His sight whom seraphim adore, before whom angels veil their faces.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="PP 252.1">Patriarchs and Prophets, 252</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayers of hypocrisy</strong>—The prayers that are offered to God to tell Him of all our wretchedness, when we do not feel wretched at all, are the prayers of hypocrisy. It is the contrite prayer that the Lord regards. “For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, and with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive <span class="pagebreak">[260]</span> the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.”</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Prayer is not intended to work any change in God; it brings us into harmony with God. It does not take the place of duty.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MYP 247.1">Messages to Young People, 247, 248</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayers that cast a chilly shadow</strong>—There are some, I fear, who do not take their troubles to God in private prayer, but reserve them for the prayer meeting, and there do up their praying for several days. Such may be named conference and prayer meeting killers. They emit no light; they edify no one. Their cold, frozen prayers and long, backslidden testimonies cast a shadow. All are glad when they get through, and it is almost impossible to throw off the chill and darkness which their prayers and exhortations bring into the meeting. From the light which I have received, our meetings should be spiritual and social, and not too long. Reserve, pride, vanity, and fear of man should be left at home. Little differences and prejudices should not be taken with us to these meetings. As in a united family, simplicity, meekness, confidence, and love should exist in the hearts of brethren and sisters who meet to be refreshed and invigorated by bringing their lights together.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="2T 578.1">Testimonies for the Church 2:578, 579</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>To expect that our prayers will always be answered in just the way we want is presumption</strong>—The prayer of faith is never lost; but to claim that it will be always answered in the very way and for the particular thing we have expected, is presumption. (<span class="egw-eng" title="1T 231.1">Testimonies for the Church 1:231</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">When our prayers seem not to be answered, we are to cling to the promise; for the time of answering will surely come, and we shall receive the blessing we need most. But to claim that prayer will always be answered in the very way and for the particular thing that we desire, is presumption. God is too wise to err, and too good to withhold any good thing from them that walk uprightly. <span class="pagebreak">[261]</span> Then do not fear to trust Him, even though you do not see the immediate answer to your prayers. Rely upon His sure promise, “Ask, and it shall be given you.”(<span class="egw-eng" title="SC 96.1">Steps to Christ, 96</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer has no merit in itself to cleanse from sin</strong>—The heathen looked upon their prayers as having in themselves merit to atone for sin. Hence the longer the prayer the greater the merit. If they could become holy by their own efforts they would have something in themselves in which to rejoice, some ground for boasting. This idea of prayer is an outworking of the principle of self-expiation which lies at the foundation of all systems of false religion. The Pharisees had adopted this pagan idea of prayer, and it is by no means extinct in our day, even among those who profess to be Christians. The repetition of set, customary phrases, when the heart feels no need of God, is of the same character as the “vain repetitions” of the heathen.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Prayer is not an expiation for sin; it has no virtue or merit of itself. All the flowery words at our command are not equivalent to one holy desire. The most eloquent prayers are but idle words if they do not express the true sentiments of the heart. But the prayer that comes from an earnest heart, when the simple wants of the soul are expressed, as we would ask an earthly friend for a favor, expecting it to be granted—this is the prayer of faith. God does not desire our ceremonial compliments, but the unspoken cry of the heart broken and subdued with a sense of its sin and utter weakness finds its way to the Father of all mercy.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MB 86.1">Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing, 86, 87</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer is no evidence of conversion if the life is not changed</strong>—Satan leads people to think that because they have felt a rapture of feeling, they are converted. But their experience does not change. Their actions are the same as before. Their lives show no good fruit. They pray often and long, and are constantly referring to the feelings they had at such and such a time. But they do not live the new life. They are deceived. Their experience goes <span class="pagebreak">[262]</span> no deeper than feeling. They build upon the sand, and when adverse winds come, their house is swept away.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Many poor souls are groping in darkness, looking for the feelings which others say they have had in their experience. They overlook the fact that the believer in Christ must work out his own salvation with fear and trembling. The convicted sinner has something to do. He must repent and show true faith.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">When Jesus speaks of the new heart, He means the mind, the life, the whole being. To have a change of heart is to withdraw the affections from the world, and fasten them upon Christ. To have a new heart is to have a new mind, new purposes, new motives. What is the sign of a new heart?—A changed life. There is a daily, hourly dying to selfishness and pride.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MYP 71.1">Messages to Young People, 71, 72</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer no substitute for obedience</strong>—Men and women, in the face of the most positive commands of God, will follow their own inclination, and then dare to pray over the matter, to prevail upon God to consent to allow them to go contrary to His expressed will. God is not pleased with such prayers. Satan comes to their side, as he did to Eve in Eden, and impresses them, and they have an exercise of mind, and this they relate as a most wonderful experience which the Lord has given them.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="RH 7-27-1886">The Review and Herald, July 27, 1886</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Communion with God imparts to the soul an intimate knowledge of His will. But many who profess the faith know not what true conversion is. They have no experience in communion with the Father through Jesus Christ, and have never felt the power of divine grace to sanctify the heart. Praying and sinning, sinning and praying, their lives are full of malice, deceit, envy, jealousy, and self-love. The prayers of this class are an abomination to God. True prayer engages the energies of the soul and affects the life. He who thus pours out his wants before God feels the emptiness of everything else under heaven.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="4T 534.1">Testimonies for the Church 4:534, 535</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[263]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-noindent">There are conditions to the fulfillment of God’s promises, and prayer can never take the place of duty. “If ye love Me,” Christ says, “Keep My commandments.”“He that hath My commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me; and he that loveth Me shall be loved of My Father, and I will love him, and will manifest Myself to him.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="John 14:15">John 14:15, 21</span>. Those who bring their petitions to God, claiming His promise while they do not comply with the conditions, insult Jehovah. They bring the name of Christ as their authority for the fulfillment of the promise, but they do not those things that would show faith in Christ and love for Him.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="COL 143.1">Christ’s Object Lessons, 143</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Prayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a friend. The eye of faith will discern God very near, and the suppliant may obtain precious evidence of the divine love and care for him. But why is it that so many prayers are never answered? Says David: “I cried unto Him with my mouth, and He was extolled with my tongue. If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.” By another prophet the Lord gives us the promise: “Ye shall seek Me, and find Me, when ye shall search for Me with all your heart.” Again, he speaks of some who “have not cried unto Me with their heart.” Such petitions are prayers of form, lip service only, which the Lord does not accept.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="4T 533.1">Testimonies for the Church 4:533</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Hurried, occasional prayers are not real communion with God</strong>—Heaven is not closed against the fervent prayers of the righteous. Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are, yet the Lord heard and in a most striking manner answered his petitions. The only reason for our lack of power with God is to be found in ourselves. If the inner life of many who profess the truth were presented before them, they would not claim to be Christians. They are not growing in grace. A hurried prayer is offered now and then, but there is no real communion with God.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">We must be much in prayer if we would make progress in the divine life. When the message of truth was first proclaimed, how <span class="pagebreak">[264]</span> much we prayed. How often was the voice of intercession heard in the chamber, in the barn, in the orchard, or the grove. Frequently we spent hours in earnest prayer, two or three together claiming the promise; often the sound of weeping was heard and then the voice of thanksgiving and the song of praise.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="5T 161.1">Testimonies for the Church 5:161, 162</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>God abhors the prayers of the selfish</strong>—I saw that there were some like Judas among those who profess to be waiting for their Lord. Satan controls them, but they know it not. God cannot approve of the least degree of covetousness or selfishness, and He abhors the prayers and exhortations of those who indulge these evil traits. As Satan sees that his time is short, he leads men on to be more and more selfish and covetous, and then exults as he sees them wrapped up in themselves, close, penurious, and selfish. If the eyes of such could be opened, they would see Satan in hellish triumph, exulting over them and laughing at the folly of those who accept his suggestions and enter his snares.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="EW 268.1">Early Writings, 268</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Dry, stale prayers help no one</strong>—The church needs the fresh, living experience of members who have habitual communion with God. Dry, stale testimonies and prayers, without the manifestation of Christ in them, are no help to the people. If everyone who claims to be a child of God were filled with faith and light and life, what a wonderful witness would be given to those who come to hear the truth! And how many souls might be won to Christ!—(<span class="egw-eng" title="6T 64.1">Testimonies for the Church 6:64</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">All the treasures of heaven were committed to Jesus Christ, that He might impart these precious gifts to the diligent, persevering seeker. He “is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="1 Corinthians 1:30">1 Corinthians 1:30</span>. But even the prayers of many are so formal that they carry with them no influence for good. They are not a savor of life. <span class="pagebreak">[265]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-indented">If teachers would humble their hearts before God and realize the responsibilities they have accepted in taking charge of the youth with the object of educating them for the future immortal life, a marked change would soon be seen in their attitude. Their prayers would not be dry and lifeless, but they would pray with the earnestness of souls who feel their peril.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="CT 371.1">Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 371, 372</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Warning against prayers that have self as their source</strong>—Our petitions to God should not proceed from hearts that are filled with selfish aspirations. God exhorts us to choose those gifts that will redound to His glory. He would have us choose the heavenly instead of the earthly. He throws open before us the possibilities and advantages of a heavenly commerce. He gives encouragement to our loftiest aims, security to our choicest treasure. When the worldly possession is swept away, the believer will rejoice in his heavenly treasure, the riches that cannot be lost in any earthly disaster.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="SD 188.1">Sons and Daughters of God, 188</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Genuine and counterfeit prayers contrasted</strong>—The poor publican who prayed, “God be merciful to me a sinner” (<span class="bible-kjv" title="Luke 18:13">Luke 18:13</span>), regarded himself as a very wicked man, and others looked upon him in the same light; but he felt his need, and with his burden of guilt and shame he came before God, asking for His mercy. His heart was open for the Spirit of God to do its gracious work and set him free from the power of sin. The Pharisee’s boastful, self-righteous prayer showed that his heart was closed against the influence of the Holy Spirit. Because of his distance from God, he had no sense of his own defilement, in contrast with the perfection of the divine holiness. He felt no need, and he received nothing.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="SC 30.1">Steps to Christ, 30, 31</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">There are two kinds of prayer—the prayer of form and the prayer of faith. The repetition of set, customary phrases when the heart feels no need of God, is formal prayer.... We should be <span class="pagebreak">[266]</span> extremely careful in all our prayers to speak the wants of the heart and to say only what we mean. All the flowery words at our command are not equivalent to one holy desire. The most eloquent prayers are but vain repetitions if they do not express the true sentiments of the heart. But the prayer that comes from an earnest heart, when the simple wants of the soul are expressed just as we would ask an earthly friend for a favor, expecting that it would be granted—this is the prayer of faith. The publican who went up to the temple to pray is a good example of a sincere, devoted worshiper. He felt that he was a sinner, and his great need led to an outburst of passionate desire, “God be merciful to me a sinner.”(<span class="egw-eng" title="ML 19.1">My Life Today, 19</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Of Christ it is said: “And being in an agony He prayed more earnestly.” In what contrast to this intercession by the Majesty of heaven are the feeble, heartless prayers that are offered to God. Many are content with lip service, and but few have a sincere, earnest, affectionate longing after God.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Communion with God imparts to the soul an intimate knowledge of His will. But many who profess the faith know not what true conversion is. They have no experience in communion with the Father through Jesus Christ, and have never felt the power of divine grace to sanctify the heart. Praying and sinning, sinning and praying, their lives are full of malice, deceit, envy, jealousy, and self-love. The prayers of this class are an abomination to God. True prayer engages the energies of the soul and affects the life. He who thus pours out his wants before God feels the emptiness of everything else under heaven. “All my desire is before Thee,” said David, “and my groaning is not hid from Thee.”“My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?”“When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me.”(<span class="egw-eng" title="4T 534.1">Testimonies for the Church 4:534, 535</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[267]</span> </p>
