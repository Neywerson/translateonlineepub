	<h2 class="chapterhead">Chapter 11—Answered Prayer</h2>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>God will answer, if we ask</strong>—Worldly wisdom teaches that prayer is not essential. Men of science claim that there can be no real answer to prayer; that this would be a violation of law, a miracle, and that miracles have no existence. The universe, say they, is governed by fixed laws, and God Himself does nothing contrary to these laws. Thus they represent God as bound by His own laws—as if the operation of divine laws could exclude divine freedom. Such teaching is opposed to the testimony of the Scriptures. Were not miracles wrought by Christ and His apostles? The same compassionate Saviour lives today, and He is as willing to listen to the prayer of faith as when He walked visibly among men. The natural cooperates with the supernatural. It is a part of God’s plan to grant us, in answer to the prayer of faith, that which He would not bestow did we not thus ask.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="GC 525.1">The Great Controversy, 525</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">When you are privileged to meet with your brethren in the church, tell them of the necessity of keeping open the channel of communication between God and the soul. Tell them that if they will find heart and voice to pray, God will find answers to their <span class="pagebreak">[97]</span> prayers. Tell them not to neglect their religious duties. Exhort the brethren to pray. We must seek if we would find, we must ask if we would receive, we must knock if we would have the door opened unto us.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="ST 2-10-1890">The Signs of the Times, February 10, 1890</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Jesus does not call on us to follow Him, and then forsake us. If we surrender our lives to His service, we can never be placed in a position for which God has not made provision. Whatever may be our situation, we have a Guide to direct our way; whatever our perplexities, we have a sure Counselor; whatever our sorrow, bereavement, or loneliness, we have a sympathizing Friend. If in our ignorance we make missteps, Christ does not leave us....</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">“All things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.” [<span class="bible-kjv" title="Matthew 21:22">Matthew 21:22</span>.]—(<span class="egw-eng" title="GW 263.1">Gospel Workers, 263</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>God’s blessings will come as a result of humble faith</strong>—A close connection with heaven will give the right tone to your fidelity and will be the ground of your success. Your feeling of dependence will drive you to prayer, and your sense of duty summon you to effort. Prayer and effort, effort and prayer, will be the business of your life. You must pray as though the efficiency and praise were all due to God, and labor as though duty were all your own. If you want power you may have it; it is waiting your draft upon it. Only believe in God, take Him at His word, act by faith, and blessings will come.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">In this matter, genius, logic, and eloquence will not avail. Those who have a humble, trusting, contrite heart, God accepts, and hears their prayer; and when God helps, all obstacles will be overcome. How many men of great natural abilities and high scholarships have failed when placed in positions of responsibility, while those of feebler intellect, with less favorable surroundings, have been wonderfully successful. The secret was: The former trusted to themselves, while the latter united with Him who is wonderful in counsel and mighty in working to accomplish what He will.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="4T 538.1">Testimonies for the Church 4:538, 539</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">The simple prayers indited by the Holy Spirit will ascend through <span class="pagebreak">[98]</span> the gates ajar, the open door which Christ has declared: I have opened, and no man can shut. These prayers, mingled with the incense of the perfection of Christ, will ascend as fragrance to the Father, and answers will come.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="6T 467.1">Testimonies for the Church 6:467</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayers of child-like simplicity and faith will be answered</strong>—“If any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink.” “Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="John 7:37">John 7:37</span>; <span class="bible-kjv" title="John 4:14">John 4:14</span>.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">If, with these promises before us, we choose to remain parched and withered for want of the water of life, it is our own fault. If we would come to Christ with the simplicity of a child coming to its earthly parents, and ask for the things that He has promised, believing that we receive them, we should have them.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="9T 179.1">Testimonies for the Church 9:179</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Pray and believe</strong>—God does not say, Ask once, and you shall receive. He bids us ask. Unwearyingly persist in prayer. The persistent asking brings the petitioner into a more earnest attitude, and gives him an increased desire to receive the things for which he asks. Christ said to Martha at the grave of Lazarus, “If thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="John 11:40">John 11:40</span>.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">But many have not a living faith. This is why they do not see more of the power of God. Their weakness is the result of their unbelief. They have more faith in their own working than in the working of God for them. They take themselves into their own keeping. They plan and devise, but pray little, and have little real trust in God. They think they have faith, but it is only the impulse of the moment. Failing to realize their own need, or God’s willingness to give, they do not persevere in keeping their requests before the Lord.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Our prayers are to be as earnest and persistent as was the petition of the needy friend who asked for the loaves at midnight. The more earnestly and steadfastly we ask, the closer will be our spiritual union with Christ. We shall receive increased <span class="pagebreak">[99]</span> blessings because we have increased faith.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Our part is to pray and believe. Watch unto prayer. Watch, and co-operate with the prayer-hearing God. Bear in mind that “we are labourers together with God.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="1 Corinthians 3:9">1 Corinthians 3:9</span>. Speak and act in harmony with your prayers. It will make an infinite difference with you whether trial shall prove your faith to be genuine, or show that your prayers are only a form.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="COL 145.1">Christ’s Object Lessons, 145, 146</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Pray in faith and answers will come</strong>—The lessons that God sends will always, if well learned, bring help in due time. Put your trust in God. Pray much, and believe. Trusting, hoping, believing, holding fast the hand of Infinite Power, you will be more than conquerors.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">True workers walk and work by faith. Sometimes they grow weary with watching the slow advance of the work when the battle wages strong between the powers of good and evil. But if they refuse to fail or be discouraged they will see the clouds breaking away and the promise of deliverance fulfilling. Through the mist with which Satan has surrounded them, they will see the shining of the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Work in faith, and leave results with God. Pray in faith, and the mystery of His providence will bring its answer. At times it may seem that you cannot succeed. But work and believe, putting into your efforts faith, hope, and courage. After doing what you can, wait for the Lord, declaring His faithfulness, and He will bring His word to pass. Wait, not in fretful anxiety, but in undaunted faith and unshaken trust.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="7T 245.1">Testimonies for the Church 7:245</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">There is strength to be obtained of God. He can help. He can give grace and heavenly wisdom. If you ask in faith, you will receive; but you must watch unto prayer. Watch, pray, work, should be your watchword.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="2T 427.1">Testimonies for the Church 2:427</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">God has sent us to work in His vineyard. It is our duty to do all we can. “In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either <span class="pagebreak">[100]</span> this or that.” We have too little faith. We limit the Holy One of Israel. We should be grateful that He condescends to use any of us as His instruments. For every earnest prayer put up in faith, an answer will be returned. It may not come just as we have expected; but it will come at the very time when we most need it. “If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.”(<span class="egw-eng" title="RH 3-23-1897">The Review and Herald, March 23, 1897</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>If we find time to pray, God will find time to answer</strong>—Every earnest petition for grace and strength will be answered.... Ask God to do for you those things that you cannot do for yourselves. Tell Jesus everything. Lay open before Him the secrets of your heart; for His eye searches the inmost recesses of the soul, and He reads your thoughts as an open book. When you have asked for the things that are necessary for your soul’s good, believe that you receive them, and you shall have them. Accept His gifts with your whole heart; for Jesus has died that you might have the precious things of heaven as your own, and at last find a home with the heavenly angels in the kingdom of God.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">If you will find voice and time to pray, God will find time and voice to answer.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="ML 16.1">My Life Today, 16</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Rejoice that God has answered your prayers</strong>—Pray in faith. And be sure to bring your lives into harmony with your petitions, that you may receive the blessings for which you pray. Let not your faith weaken, for the blessings received are proportionate to the faith exercised. “According to your faith be it unto you.”“All things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Matthew 9:29">Matthew 9:29</span>; <span class="bible-kjv" title="Matthew 21:22">Matthew 21:22</span>. Pray, believe, rejoice. Sing praises to God because He has answered your prayers. Take Him at His word. “He is faithful that promised.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Hebrews 10:23">Hebrews 10:23</span>. Not one sincere supplication is lost. The channel is open; the stream is flowing. It carries with it healing properties, pouring forth a restoring current of life and health and salvation.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="7T 274.1">Testimonies for the Church 7:274</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[101]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>The very intensity of our prayers is a pledge that God will answer</strong>—When a man breathes an intensely earnest prayer to God (Jesus Christ is the only name given under heaven whereby we can be saved), there is in that intensity and earnestness a pledge from God that He is about to answer that prayer exceeding abundantly, above all that we can ask or think. We must not only pray in the name of Jesus, but by the inspiration and kindling of the Holy Spirit. This explains what is meant when it is said, “the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which can not be uttered.” The petitions must be offered in earnest faith. Then they will reach the mercy-seat. Unwearyingly persist in prayer. God does not say, Pray once, and I will answer you. His word is pray, be instant in prayer, believing ye have the things ye ask, and ye shall receive them; I will answer you.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="GH 5-28-1902">The Gospel Herald, May 28, 1902</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Conditions to answered prayer</strong>—There are certain conditions upon which we may expect that God will hear and answer our prayers. One of the first of these is that we feel our need of help from Him. He has promised, “I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Isaiah 44:3">Isaiah 44:3</span>. Those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, who long after God, may be sure that they will be filled. The heart must be open to the Spirit’s influence, or God’s blessing cannot be received.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Our great need is itself an argument and pleads most eloquently in our behalf. But the Lord is to be sought unto to do these things for us. He says, “Ask, and it shall be given you.” And “He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Matthew 7:7">Matthew 7:7</span>; <span class="bible-kjv" title="Romans 8:32">Romans 8:32</span>.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">If we regard iniquity in our hearts, if we cling to any known sin, the Lord will not hear us; but the prayer of the penitent, contrite soul is always accepted. When all known wrongs are righted, we may believe that God will answer our petitions. Our own merit will never commend us to the favor of God; it is the worthiness of Jesus that will save us, His blood that will cleanse us; yet we have a work to do in complying with the conditions of acceptance. <span class="pagebreak">[102]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Another element of prevailing prayer is faith. “He that cometh to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Hebrews 11:6">Hebrews 11:6</span>. Jesus said to His disciples, “What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Mark 11:24">Mark 11:24</span>. Do we take Him at His word?</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">The assurance is broad and unlimited, and He is faithful who has promised. When we do not receive the very things we asked for, at the time we ask, we are still to believe that the Lord hears and that He will answer our prayers. We are so erring and shortsighted that we sometimes ask for things that would not be a blessing to us, and our heavenly Father in love answers our prayers by giving us that which will be for our highest good—that which we ourselves would desire if with vision divinely enlightened we could see all things as they really are. When our prayers seem not to be answered, we are to cling to the promise; for the time of answering will surely come, and we shall receive the blessing we need most. But to claim that prayer will always be answered in the very way and for the particular thing that we desire, is presumption. God is too wise to err, and too good to withhold any good thing from them that walk uprightly. Then do not fear to trust Him, even though you do not see the immediate answer to your prayers. Rely upon His sure promise, “Ask, and it shall be given you.”</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">If we take counsel with our doubts and fears, or try to solve everything that we cannot see clearly, before we have faith, perplexities will only increase and deepen. But if we come to God, feeling helpless and dependent, as we really are, and in humble, trusting faith make known our wants to Him whose knowledge is infinite, who sees everything in creation, and who governs everything by His will and word, He can and will attend to our cry, and will let light shine into our hearts. Through sincere prayer we are brought into connection with the mind of the Infinite. We may have no remarkable evidence at the time that the face of our Redeemer is bending over us in compassion and love, but this is even so. We may not feel His visible touch, but His hand is upon us in love and pitying tenderness. <span class="pagebreak">[103]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-noindent">When we come to ask mercy and blessing from God we should have a spirit of love and forgiveness in our own hearts. How can we pray, “Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors,” and yet indulge an unforgiving spirit? <span class="bible-kjv" title="Matthew 6:12">Matthew 6:12</span>. If we expect our own prayers to be heard we must forgive others in the same manner and to the same extent as we hope to be forgiven.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Perseverance in prayer has been made a condition of receiving. We must pray always if we would grow in faith and experience. We are to be “instant in prayer,” to “continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Romans 12:12">Romans 12:12</span>; <span class="bible-kjv" title="Colossians 4:2">Colossians 4:2</span>. Peter exhorts believers to be “sober, and watch unto prayer.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="1 Peter 4:7">1 Peter 4:7</span>. Paul directs, “In everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Philippians 4:6">Philippians 4:6</span>. “But ye, beloved,” says Jude, “praying in the Holy Ghost, keep yourselves in the love of God.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Jude 1:20">Jude 20, 21</span>.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="SC 95.1">Steps to Christ, 95-97</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">If we render to Him only a partial, halfhearted obedience, His promises will not be fulfilled to us.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MH 227.1">The Ministry of Healing, 227</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>We must live our prayers if they are to be answered</strong>—We are to pray and watch unto prayer, that there may be no inconsistency in our lives. We must not fail to show others that we understand that watching unto prayer means living our prayers before God, that He may answer them.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="1SM 116.1">Selected Messages 1:116, 117</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer is of no avail if the life does not match the prayer</strong>—“If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.” When you pray, present this promise. It is our privilege to come to Him with holy boldness. As in sincerity we ask Him to let His light shine upon us, He will hear and answer us. But we must live in harmony with our prayers. They are of no avail if we walk contrary to them. I have seen a father who, after reading a portion of scripture and offering prayer, would often, almost as soon as he had risen from his knees, begin to scold his children. How could God answer the <span class="pagebreak">[104]</span> prayer he had offered? And if, after scolding his children, a father offers prayer, does that prayer benefit the children? No; not unless it is a prayer of confession to God.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="CG 499.1">Child Guidance, 499</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Praise needs to be included if our prayers are to be answered</strong>—Shall all our devotional exercises consist in asking and receiving? Shall we be always thinking of our wants and never of the benefits we receive? Shall we be recipients of His mercies and never express our gratitude to God, never praise Him for what He has done for us? We do not pray any too much, but we are too sparing of giving thanks. If the loving-kindness of God called forth more thanksgiving and praise, we would have far more power in prayer. We would abound more and more in the love of God and have more bestowed to praise Him for. You who complain that God does not hear your prayers, change your present order and mingle praise with your petitions. When you consider His goodness and mercies you will find that He will consider your wants.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Pray, pray earnestly and without ceasing, but do not forget to praise.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="5T 317.1">Testimonies for the Church 5:317</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Unfaithfulness in stewardship may be a cause of unanswered prayer</strong>—As the Giver of every blessing, God claims a certain portion of all we possess. This is His provision to sustain the preaching of the gospel. And by making this return to God, we are to show our appreciation of His gifts. But if we withhold from Him that which is His own, how can we expect Him to entrust us with the things of heaven? It may be that here is the secret of unanswered prayer.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="COL 144.1">Christ’s Object Lessons, 144</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>We insult God by claiming the promise without meeting the conditions</strong>—There are conditions to the fulfillment of God’s promises, and prayer can never take the place of duty. “If ye love Me,” Christ says, “Keep My commandments.”“He that hath My commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me; and he that loveth Me shall be loved of My Father, and I will love him, <span class="pagebreak">[105]</span> and will manifest Myself to him.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="John 14:15">John 14:15, 21</span>. Those who bring their petitions to God, claiming His promise while they do not comply with the conditions, insult Jehovah. They bring the name of Christ as their authority for the fulfillment of the promise, but they do not those things that would show faith in Christ and love for Him.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="COL 143.1">Christ’s Object Lessons, 143</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>If the conditions are met, the promise of answered prayer is unequivocal</strong>—Prayer and faith are closely allied, and they need to be studied together. In the prayer of faith there is a divine science; it is a science that everyone who would make his lifework a success must understand. Christ says, “What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Mark 11:24">Mark 11:24</span>. He makes it plain that our asking must be according to God’s will; we must ask for the things that He has promised, and whatever we receive must be used in doing His will. The conditions met, the promise is unequivocal.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">For the pardon of sin, for the Holy Spirit, for a Christlike temper, for wisdom and strength to do His work, for any gift He has promised, we may ask; then we are to believe that we receive, and return thanks to God that we have received.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">We need look for no outward evidence of the blessing. The gift is in the promise, and we may go about our work assured that what God has promised He is able to perform, and that the gift, which we already possess, will be realized when we need it most.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="Ed 257.1">Education, 257, 258</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Our prayers are not commands to God</strong>—We know that He hears us if we ask according to His will. Our petitions must not take the form of a command, but of intercession for Him to do the things we desire of Him.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="2T 149.1">Testimonies for the Church 2:149</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayers not always answered immediately</strong>—God has a heaven full of blessings for those who will co-operate with Him. All who obey Him may with confidence claim the fulfillment of His promises. <span class="pagebreak">[106]</span> But we must show a firm, undeviating trust in God. Often He delays to answer us in order to try our faith or test the genuineness of our desire. Having asked according to His word, we should believe His promise and press our petitions with a determination that will not be denied.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="COL 145.1">Christ’s Object Lessons, 145</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">When those who know the truth practice the self-denial enjoined in God’s word, the message will go with power. The Lord will hear our prayers for the conversion of souls. God’s people will let their light shine forth, and unbelievers, seeing their good works, will glorify our heavenly Father.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MYP 315.1">Messages to Young People, 315</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Christ’s two days’ delay after hearing that Lazarus was sick was not a neglect or a denial on His part. It was His purpose to remain where He was till the death of Lazarus took place, that He might give the people an evidence of His divinity, not by restoring a dying man, but by raising to life a man that had been buried.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">This should be an encouragement to us. We are sometimes tempted to think that the promise, “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you,” is not fulfilled unless the answer comes immediately when the request is made. It is our privilege to ask for special blessings, and to believe that they will be given us. But if the blessings asked for are not immediately granted, we are not to think that our prayers are not heard. We shall receive, even if the answer is delayed for a time. In carrying out the plan of redemption, Christ sees enough in humanity to discourage Him. But He does not become discouraged. In mercy and love He continues to offer us opportunities and privileges. So we are to rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him. The answer to our prayers may not come as quickly as we desire, and it may not be just what we have asked; but He who knows what is for the highest good of His children will bestow a much greater good than we have asked, if we do not become faithless and discouraged.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="YI 4-6-1899">The Youth’s Instructor, April 6, 1899</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[107]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-noindent">We all desire immediate and direct answers to our prayers, and are tempted to become discouraged when the answer is delayed or comes in an unlooked-for form. But God is too wise and good to answer our prayers always at just the time and in just the manner we desire. He will do more and better for us than to accomplish all our wishes. And because we can trust His wisdom and love, we should not ask Him to concede to our will, but should seek to enter into and accomplish His purpose. Our desires and interests should be lost in His will. These experiences that test faith are for our benefit. By them it is made manifest whether our faith is true and sincere, resting on the word of God alone, or whether depending on circumstances, it is uncertain and changeable. Faith is strengthened by exercise. We must let patience have its perfect work, remembering that there are precious promises in the Scriptures for those who wait upon the Lord.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MH 230.1">The Ministry of Healing, 230, 231</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">I saw that the servants of God and the church were too easily discouraged. When they asked their Father in Heaven for things they thought they needed, and because it did not immediately come, their faith wavered, their courage fled, and a murmuring feeling took possession of them. This I saw displeased God.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Every saint that comes to God with a true heart, in faith, and sends their honest petitions to Him, will have their prayers answered. Their faith must not let go of the promises of God if they do not see or feel the immediate answer of their prayers. Be not afraid to trust God. Rely upon His sure promise, “Ask and ye shall receive.” God is too wise to err, and too good to withhold any good thing from His saints that walk uprightly. Man is erring, and although his petitions are sent up from an honest heart, he does not always ask for the things that are good for himself, or that will glorify God. When this is so, our wise and good Father hears our prayers, and will answer; sometimes immediately, but gives us the things that are for our best good and His own glory.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">If the children of God could see His plan, they would know that He gives them that which is for their best good. Although they <span class="pagebreak">[108]</span> may not receive just the things they expected, or asked for, yet their prayers were answered. Nothing hurtful was given, but the blessing they most needed, in the place of something they had asked for, that would not have been good for them, but to their hurt.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">I saw if we did not feel immediate answers to our prayers, we should hold fast our faith, let no distrust come in; for that will separate us from God. If our faith wavers, we shall receive nothing from Him. Our confidence in God should be strong, and when we need it the most, the blessing will drop upon us like a shower of rain.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">When the servants of God have prayed for His Spirit and blessing, it sometimes comes immediately, but it is not always then bestowed. At such times faint not. Let thy faith hold fast the promise, that it will come. Let thy trust be fully in God, and often that blessing will come when you need it the most, and unexpectedly you will receive help from God, when you are speaking the truth to unbelievers, and with clearness you can speak the word, and with power.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">It was represented to me like children asking a blessing of their earthly parents that love them. They ask something that the parent knows will hurt them; the parent gives them the things that will be good and healthy for them, in the place of that which the child desired. I saw that every prayer that was sent up in faith from an honest heart will be heard of God and answered, and the one that sent up the petition will have the blessing when he needs it the most, and it will often exceed his expectations. Not a prayer of the true saint is lost if sent up from an honest heart in faith.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="4bSG 7.1">Spiritual Gifts 4b, 7-9</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">After the prayer is made, if the answer is not realized immediately, do not weary of waiting and become unstable. Waver not. Cling to the promise, “Faithful is He that calleth you, who also will do it.” Like the importunate widow, urge your case, being firm in your purpose. Is the object important and of great consequence to you? It certainly is. Then waver not, for your faith may be tried. If the thing you desire is valuable, it is worthy of a strong, earnest effort. You have the promise; watch and pray. Be steadfast and the prayer will be answered; for is it not God who has promised? If it costs you something <span class="pagebreak">[109]</span> to obtain it you will prize it the more when obtained. You are plainly told that if you waver you need not think that you shall receive anything of the Lord. A caution is here given not to become weary, but to rest firmly upon the promise. If you ask, He will give you liberally and upbraid not.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="2T 131.1">Testimonies for the Church 2:131</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">“Ask, and ye shall receive.” The assurance is broad and unlimited, and He is faithful who has promised. We sometimes fail in faith because Infinite Wisdom does not come to our terms. When for any reason we do not receive the very things we ask for at the time we ask, we are still to believe that the Lord hears, and that He will give us those things that are best for us. His own glory is a sufficient reason for sometimes withholding what we ask for, and answering our prayers in a manner that we did not expect. But we are to cling to the promise; for the time of answering will come, and we shall receive the blessings we need most.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="ST 8-21-1884">The Signs of the Times, August 21, 1884</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>God does not always answer as we expect, but always for our good</strong>—Ask, then; ask, and ye shall receive. Ask for humility, wisdom, courage, increase of faith. To every sincere prayer an answer will come. It may not come just as you desire, or at the time you look for it; but it will come in the way and at the time that will best meet your need. The prayers you offer in loneliness, in weariness, in trial, God answers, not always according to your expectations, but always for your good.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MYP 250.1">Messages to Young People, 250</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">While you prayed in your affliction for peace in Christ, a cloud of darkness seemed to blacken across your mind. The rest and peace did not come as you expected. At times your faith seemed to be tested to the utmost. As you looked back to your past life, you saw sorrow and disappointment; as you viewed the future, all was uncertainty. The divine Hand led you wondrously to bring you to the cross and to teach you that God was indeed a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him. Those who ask aright will receive. He that seeketh in faith shall find. The experience gained in the furnace <span class="pagebreak">[110]</span> of trial and affliction is worth more than all the inconvenience and painful experience it costs.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">The prayers that you offered in your loneliness, in your weariness and trial, God answered, not always according to your expectations, but for your good. You did not have clear and correct views of your brethren, neither did you see yourself in a correct light. But, in the providence of God, He has been at work to answer the prayers you have offered in your distress, in a way to save you and glorify His own name. In your ignorance of yourself you asked for things which were not best for you. God heard your prayers of sincerity, but the blessing granted was something very different from your expectations. God designed, in His providence, to place you more directly in connection with His church, that your confidence might be less in yourself and greater in others whom He is leading out to advance His work.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">God hears every sincere prayer.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="3T 415.1">Testimonies for the Church 3:415, 416</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>God answers prayer at his own appointed time</strong>—Throughout his married life, Zacharias had prayed for a son. He and his wife were now old, and as yet their prayer had remained unanswered; but he murmured not. God had not forgotten. He had His appointed time for answering this prayer, and when the case seemed hopeless, Zacharias received his answer.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="5BC 1114.1">SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, 1114</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Why answers to prayer may be delayed</strong>—God does not always answer our prayers the first time we call upon Him; for should He do this, we might take it for granted that we had a right to all the blessings and favors He bestowed upon us. Instead of searching our hearts to see if any evil was entertained by us, any sin indulged, we would become careless, and fail to realize our dependence upon Him, and our need of His help.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="RH 6-9-1891">The Review and Herald, June 9, 1891</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">There are precious promises in the Scriptures to those who wait upon the Lord. We all desire an immediate answer to our prayers and are tempted to become discouraged if our prayer is <span class="pagebreak">[111]</span> not immediately answered. Now, my experience has taught me that this is a great mistake. The delay is for our special benefit. We have a chance to see whether our faith is true and sincere or changeable like the waves of the sea. We must bind ourselves upon the altar with the strong cords of faith and love, and let patience have her perfect work. Faith strengthens through continual exercise. This waiting does not mean that because we ask the Lord to heal there is nothing for us to do. On the contrary, we are to make the very best use of the means which the Lord in His goodness has provided for us in our necessities.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="CH 380.1">Counsels on Health, 380, 381</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Keep asking, even if the answer does not come</strong>—Sometimes answers to our prayers come immediately; sometimes we have to wait patiently and continue earnestly to plead for the things that we need, our cases being illustrated by the case of the importunate solicitor for bread. “Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight,” etc. This lesson means more than we can imagine. We are to keep on asking, even if we do not realize the immediate response to our prayers. “I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. For everyone that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Luke 11:9">Luke 11:9, 10</span>.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">We need grace, we need divine enlightenment, that through the Spirit we may know how to ask for such things as we need. If our petitions are indited by the Lord they will be answered.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="CH 380.1">Counsels on Health, 380</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Answers delayed to reveal our selfishness</strong>—He who blessed the nobleman at Capernaum is just as desirous of blessing us. But like the afflicted father, we are often led to seek Jesus by the desire for some earthly good; and upon the granting of our request we rest our confidence in His love. The Saviour longs to give us a greater blessing than we ask; and He delays the answer to our request that He may show us the evil of our own hearts, and our deep need of His grace. He desires us to renounce the selfishness <span class="pagebreak">[112]</span> that leads us to seek Him. Confessing our helplessness and bitter need, we are to trust ourselves wholly to His love.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">The nobleman wanted to see the fulfillment of his prayer before he should believe; but he had to accept the word of Jesus that his request was heard and the blessing granted. This lesson we also have to learn. Not because we see or feel that God hears us are we to believe. We are to trust in His promises. When we come to Him in faith, every petition enters the heart of God. When we have asked for His blessing, we should believe that we receive it, and thank Him that we have received it. Then we are to go about our duties, assured that the blessing will be realized when we need it most. When we have learned to do this, we shall know that our prayers are answered. God will do for us “exceeding abundantly”, “according to the riches of His glory,” and “the working of His mighty power.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Ephesians 3:20">Ephesians 3:20, 16</span>; <span class="bible-kjv" title="Ephesians 1:19">Ephesians 1:19</span>.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="DA 200.1">The Desire of Ages, 200</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Seemingly unanswered prayers may be among our greatest blessings</strong>—In His loving care and interest for us, often He who understands us better than we understand ourselves refuses to permit us selfishly to seek the gratification of our own ambition. He does not permit us to pass by the homely but sacred duties that lie next us. Often these duties afford the very training essential to prepare us for a higher work. Often our plans fail that God’s plans for us may succeed.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">We are never called upon to make a real sacrifice for God. Many things He asks us to yield to Him, but in doing this we are but giving up that which hinders us in the heavenward way. Even when called upon to surrender those things which in themselves are good, we may be sure that God is thus working out for us some higher good.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">In the future life the mysteries that here have annoyed and disappointed us will be made plain. We shall see that our seemingly unanswered prayers and disappointed hopes have been among our greatest blessings.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">We are to look upon every duty, however humble, as sacred because it is a part of God’s service. Our daily prayer should be, “Lord, help me to do my best. Teach me how to do better work. <span class="pagebreak">[113]</span> Give me energy and cheerfulness. Help me to bring into my service the loving ministry of the Saviour.”(<span class="egw-eng" title="MH 473.1">The Ministry of Healing, 473, 474</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Sometimes God does not give us what we pray for because he has something better for us</strong>—When we come to Him we should pray that we may enter into and accomplish His purpose, and that our desires and interests may be lost in His. We should acknowledge our acceptance of His will, not praying Him to concede to ours. It is better for us that God does not always answer our prayers just when we desire, and in just the manner we wish. He will do more and better for us than to accomplish all our wishes, for our wisdom is folly.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="2T 148.1">Testimonies for the Church 2:148</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">That prayer which comes forth from an earnest, believing heart is the effectual, fervent prayer that availeth much. God does not always answer our prayers as we expect, for we may not ask what would be for our highest good; but in His infinite love and wisdom He will give us those things which we most need.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="4T 531.1">Testimonies for the Church 4:531</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>We are to cooperate with God in answering our prayers</strong>—In the Word of God are represented two contending parties that influence and control human agencies in our world. Constantly these parties are working with every human being. Those who are under God’s control and who are influenced by the heavenly angels, will be able to discern the crafty workings of the unseen powers of darkness. Those who desire to be in harmony with the heavenly agencies should be intensely in earnest to do God’s will. They must give no place whatever to Satan and his angels.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">But unless we are constantly on guard, we shall be overcome by the enemy. Although a solemn revelation of God’s will concerning us has been revealed to all, yet a knowledge of His will does not set aside the necessity of offering earnest supplications to Him for help, and of diligently seeking to cooperate with Him in answering the prayers offered. He accomplishes His purposes through human instrumentalities.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="6BC 1119.1">SDA Bible Commentary 6:1119</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[114]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-noindent"><strong>Half-hearted prayers will not bring answers</strong>—God will be to us everything we will let Him be. Our languid, half-hearted prayers will not bring us returns from heaven. Oh, we need to press our petitions! Ask in faith, wait in faith, receive in faith, rejoice in hope, for everyone that seeketh findeth. Be in earnest in the matter. Seek God with all the heart. People put soul and earnestness into everything they undertake in temporal things, until their efforts are crowned with success. With intense earnestness learn the trade of seeking the rich blessings that God has promised, and with persevering, determined effort you shall have His light and His truth and His rich grace.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">In sincerity, in soul hunger, cry after God. Wrestle with the heavenly agencies until you have the victory. Put your whole being into the Lord’s hands, soul, body, and spirit, and resolve to be His loving, consecrated agency, moved by His will, controlled by His mind, infused by His Spirit.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Tell Jesus your wants in the sincerity of your soul. You are not required to hold a long controversy with, or preach a sermon to, God, but with a heart of sorrow for your sins, say, “Save me, Lord, or I perish.” There is hope for such souls. They will seek, they will ask, they will knock, and they will find. When Jesus has taken away the burden of sin that is crushing the soul, you will experience the blessedness of the peace of Christ.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="OHC 131.1">Our High Calling, 131</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>The prayer for forgiveness is always answered at once</strong>—In some instances of healing, Jesus did not at once grant the blessing sought. But in the case of leprosy, no sooner was the appeal made than it was granted. When we pray for earthly blessings, the answer to our prayer may be delayed, or God may give us something other than we ask, but not so when we ask for deliverance from sin. It is His will to cleanse us from sin, to make us His children, and to enable us to live a holy life. Christ “gave Himself for our sins, that He might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Galatians 1:4">Galatians 1:4</span>. And “this is the confidence that we have in Him, that, if we ask anything <span class="pagebreak">[115]</span> according to His will, He heareth us: and if we know that He hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of Him.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="1 John 5:14">1 John 5:14, 15</span>. “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="1 John 1:9">1 John 1:9</span>.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="DA 266.1">The Desire of Ages, 266</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Christ presents our prayers before the father as his own request</strong>—No sooner does the child of God approach the mercy seat than he becomes the client of the great Advocate. At his first utterance of penitence and appeal for pardon Christ espouses his case and makes it His own, presenting the supplication before His Father as His own request.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="6T 364.1">Testimonies for the Church 6:364</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Pray to thank and praise God for answered prayers</strong>—In the second chapter of 1 Samuel is recorded the prayer of a consecrated woman who served and glorified God. She prayed: “My heart rejoiceth in the Lord, mine horn is exalted in the Lord: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation. There is none holy as the Lord: for there is none beside thee: neither is there any rock like our God.” Hannah’s offering of thanksgiving for the answer to her prayer is a lesson to those who today receive answers to their requests. Do we not neglect to return praise and thanksgiving to God for His loving-kindness?</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">David declares, “I love the Lord, because He hath heard my voice and my supplications. Because He hath inclined His ear unto me, therefore will I call upon Him as long as I live.” God’s goodness in hearing and answering prayer places us under heavy obligation to express our thanksgiving for the favors bestowed upon us. We should praise God much more than we do. The blessings received in answer to prayer should be promptly acknowledged. The record of them should be placed in our diary, that when we take the book in hand, we may remember the goodness of the Lord, and praise His holy name.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="RH 5-7-1908">The Review and Herald, May 7, 1908</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[116]</span> </p>
