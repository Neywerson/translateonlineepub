	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>God hears the prayer of the humble</strong>—Our heavenly Father waits to bestow upon us the fullness of His blessing. It is our privilege to drink largely at the fountain of boundless love. What a wonder it is that we pray so little! God is ready and willing to hear the sincere prayer of the humblest of His children, and yet there is much manifest reluctance on our part to make known our wants to God. What can the angels of heaven think of poor helpless human beings, who are subject to temptation, when God’s heart of infinite love yearns toward them, ready to give them more than they can ask or think, and yet they pray so little and have so little faith? The angels love to bow before God; they love to be near Him. They regard communion with God as their highest joy; and yet the children of earth, who need so much the help that God only can give, seem satisfied to walk without the light of His Spirit, the companionship of His presence.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="SC 94.1">Steps to Christ, 94</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Those who have a humble, trusting, contrite heart, God accepts, and hears their prayer; and when God helps, all obstacles will be overcome. How many men of great natural abilities and <span class="pagebreak">[34]</span> high scholarships have failed when placed in positions of responsibility, while those of feebler intellect, with less favorable surroundings, have been wonderfully successful. The secret was: The former trusted to themselves, while the latter united with Him who is wonderful in counsel and mighty in working to accomplish what He will.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="4T 538.1">Testimonies for the Church 4:538, 539</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>God hears and answers prayer</strong>—God hears prayer. Christ has said, “If ye shall ask anything in My name, I will do it.” Again He says, “If any man serve Me, him will My Father honor.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="John 14:14">John 14:14</span>; <span class="bible-kjv" title="John 12:26">John 12:26</span>. If we live according to His word, every precious promise He has given will be fulfilled to us. We are undeserving of His mercy, but as we give ourselves to Him, He receives us. He will work for and through those who follow Him.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MH 226.1">The Ministry of Healing, 226, 227</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">The Lord will certainly hear and answer the prayers of His workers if they will seek Him for counsel and instruction.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="Ev 399.1">Evangelism, 399</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">God hears the prayers of all who seek Him in truth. He has the power that we all need. He fills the heart with love, and joy, and peace, and holiness.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="9T 169.1">Testimonies for the Church 9:169</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">I saw that every prayer which is sent up in faith from an honest heart will be heard of God and answered, and the one that sent up the petition will have the blessing when he needs it most, and it will often exceed his expectations. Not a prayer of a true saint is lost if sent up in faith from an honest heart.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="1T 121.1">Testimonies for the Church 1:121</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>God listens to every prayer</strong>—The infinite God, said Jesus, makes it your privilege to approach Him by the name of Father. Understand all that this implies. No earthly parent ever pleaded so earnestly with an erring child as He who made you pleads with the transgressor. <span class="pagebreak">[35]</span> No human, loving interest ever followed the impenitent with such tender invitations. God dwells in every abode; He hears every word that is spoken, listens to every prayer that is offered, tastes the sorrows and disappointments of every soul, regards the treatment given to father, mother, sister, friend, and neighbor. He cares for our necessities, and His love and mercy and grace are continually flowing to satisfy our need.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="ST 10-28-1903">The Signs of the Times, October 28, 1903</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>God hears every sincere prayer</strong>—The Bible shows us God in His high and holy place, not in a state of inactivity, not in silence and solitude, but surrounded by ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands of holy intelligences, all waiting to do His will. Through channels which we cannot discern He is in active communication with every part of His dominion. But it is in this speck of a world, in the souls that He gave His only-begotten Son to save, that His interest and the interest of all heaven is centered. God is bending from His throne to hear the cry of the oppressed. To every sincere prayer He answers, “Here am I.” He uplifts the distressed and downtrodden. In all our afflictions He is afflicted. In every temptation and every trial the angel of His presence is near to deliver.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="DA 356.1">The Desire of Ages, 356</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">As yet the disciples were unacquainted with the Saviour’s unlimited resources and power. He said to them, “Hitherto have ye asked nothing in My name.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="John 16:24">John 16:24</span>. He explained that the secret of their success would be in asking for strength and grace in His name. He would be present before the Father to make request for them. The prayer of the humble suppliant He presents as His own desire in that soul’s behalf. Every sincere prayer is heard in heaven. It may not be fluently expressed; but if the heart is in it, it will ascend to the sanctuary where Jesus ministers, and He will present it to the Father without one awkward, stammering word, beautiful and fragrant with the incense of His own perfection.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">The path of sincerity and integrity is not a path free from obstruction, but in every difficulty we are to see a call to prayer. <span class="pagebreak">[36]</span> There is no one living who has any power that he has not received from God, and the source whence it comes is open to the weakest human being. “Whatsoever ye shall ask in My name,” said Jesus, “that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask anything in My name, I will do it.”</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">“In My name,” Christ bade His disciples pray. In Christ’s name His followers are to stand before God. Through the value of the sacrifice made for them, they are of value in the Lord’s sight. Because of the imputed righteousness of Christ they are accounted precious. For Christ’s sake the Lord pardons those that fear Him. He does not see in them the vileness of the sinner. He recognizes in them the likeness of His Son, in whom they believe.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="DA 667.1">The Desire of Ages, 667</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>No sincere prayer is lost</strong>—Make your requests known to your Maker. Never is one repulsed who comes to Him with a contrite heart. Not one sincere prayer is lost. Amid the anthems of the celestial choir, God hears the cries of the weakest human being. We pour out our heart’s desire in our closets, we breathe a prayer as we walk by the way, and our words reach the throne of the Monarch of the universe. They may be inaudible to any human ear, but they cannot die away into silence, nor can they be lost through the activities of business that are going on. Nothing can drown the soul’s desire. It rises above the din of the street, above the confusion of the multitude, to the heavenly courts. It is God to whom we are speaking, and our prayer is heard. You who feel the most unworthy, fear not to commit your case to God.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="HP 82.1">In Heavenly Places, 82</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>God hears Jesus’ intercession mingled with our prayers</strong>—Christ has pledged Himself to be our substitute and surety, and He neglects no one. There is an inexhaustible fund of perfect obedience accruing from His obedience. In heaven His merits, His self-denial and self-sacrifice, are treasured as incense to be offered up with the prayers of His people. As the sinner’s sincere, humble <span class="pagebreak">[37]</span> prayers ascend to the throne of God, Christ mingles with them the merits of His own life of perfect obedience. Our prayers are made fragrant by this incense. Christ has pledged Himself to intercede in our behalf, and the Father always hears His Son.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="SD 22.1">Sons and Daughters of God, 22</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>God always responds, though we may not realize it</strong>—If we come to God, feeling helpless and dependent, as we really are, and in humble, trusting faith make known our wants to Him whose knowledge is infinite, who sees everything in creation, and who governs everything by His will and word, He can and will attend to our cry, and will let light shine into our hearts. Through sincere prayer we are brought into connection with the mind of the Infinite. We may have no remarkable evidence at the time that the face of our Redeemer is bending over us in compassion and love, but this is even so. We may not feel His visible touch, but His hand is upon us in love and pitying tenderness.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="SC 97.1">Steps to Christ, 97</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>God’s answers are not always what we expect</strong>—Ask, then; ask, and ye shall receive. Ask for humility, wisdom, courage, increase of faith. To every sincere prayer an answer will come. It may not come just as you desire, or at the time you look for it; but it will come in the way and at the time that will best meet your need. The prayers you offer in loneliness, in weariness, in trial, God answers, not always according to your expectations, but always for your good.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MYP 250.1">Messages to Young People, 250</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>God hears prayers for the conversion of souls</strong>—When those who know the truth practice the self-denial enjoined in God’s word, the message will go with power. The Lord will hear our prayers for the conversion of souls. God’s people will let their light shine forth, and unbelievers, seeing their good works, will glorify our heavenly Father.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="CS 302.1">Counsels on Stewardship, 302</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[38]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Believe that God hears your prayers</strong>—The people of God must move understandingly. They should not be satisfied until every known sin is confessed; then it is their privilege and duty to believe that Jesus accepts them. They must not wait for others to press through the darkness and obtain the victory for them to enjoy. Such enjoyment will last only till the meeting closes. But God must be served from principle instead of from feeling. Morning and night obtain the victory for yourselves in your own family. Let not your daily labor keep you from this. Take time to pray, and as you pray, believe that God hears you. Have faith mixed with your prayers. You may not at all times feel the immediate answer; but then it is that faith is tried. You are proved to see whether you will trust in God, whether you have living, abiding faith. “Faithful is He that calleth you, who also will do it.” Walk the narrow plank of faith. Trust all on the promises of the Lord. Trust God in darkness. That is the time to have faith. But you often let feeling govern you. You look for worthiness in yourselves when you do not feel comforted by the Spirit of God, and despair because you cannot find it. You do not trust enough in Jesus, precious Jesus. You do not make His worthiness to be all, all. The very best you can do will not merit the favor of God. It is Jesus’ worthiness that will save you, His blood that will cleanse you. But you have efforts to make. You must do what you can on your part. Be zealous and repent, then believe.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="1T 167.1">Testimonies for the Church 1:167</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[39]</span> </p>
