	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer is as essential to life as daily food</strong>—Daily prayer is as essential to growth in grace, and even to spiritual life itself, as is temporal food to physical well-being. We should accustom ourselves to often lift the thoughts to God in prayer. If the mind wanders, we must bring it back; by persevering effort, habit will finally make it easy. We cannot for one moment separate ourselves from Christ with safety. We may have His presence to attend us at every step, but only by observing the conditions which He has Himself laid down.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MYP 115.1">Messages to Young People, 115</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer is a spiritual necessity</strong>—Although Christ had given the promise to His disciples that they should receive the Holy Spirit, this did not remove the necessity of prayer. They prayed all the more earnestly; they continued in prayer with one accord. Those who are now engaged in the solemn work of preparing a people for the coming of the Lord, should also continue in prayer.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="GW 371.1">Gospel Workers, 371</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">They [Jesus’ disciples] had not heeded the repeated warning, “Watch and pray.” At first they had been much troubled to see <span class="pagebreak">[18]</span> their Master, usually so calm and dignified, wrestling with a sorrow that was beyond comprehension. They had prayed as they heard the strong cries of the sufferer. They did not intend to forsake their Lord, but they seemed paralyzed by a stupor which they might have shaken off if they had continued pleading with God. They did not realize the necessity of watchfulness and earnest prayer in order to withstand temptation.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="DA 688.1">The Desire of Ages, 688</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">The experience of the disciples in the Garden of Gethsemane contains a lesson for the Lord’s people today.... They did not realize the necessity of watchfulness and earnest prayer in order to withstand temptation. Many today are fast asleep, as were the disciples. They are not watching and praying lest they enter into temptation. Let us often read and give careful study to those portions of God’s Word that have special reference to these last days, pointing out the dangers that will threaten God’s people.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="HP 97.1">In Heavenly Places, 97</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer is the life of the soul</strong>—Prayer is a necessity; for it is the life of the soul. Family prayer, public prayer, have their place; but it is secret communion with God that sustains the soul life.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="Ed 258.1">Education, 258</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer necessary for spiritual health</strong>—Several times each day precious, golden moments should be consecrated to prayer and the study of the Scriptures, if it is only to commit a text to memory, that spiritual life may exist in the soul. The varied interests of the cause furnish us with food for reflection and inspiration for our prayers. Communion with God is highly essential for spiritual health, and here only may be obtained that wisdom and correct judgment so necessary in the performance of every duty.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="4T 459.1">Testimonies for the Church 4:459</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Christ’s example shows the necessity of prayer</strong>—If those who sound the solemn notes of warning for this time could realize their accountability to God, they would see the necessity for fervent prayer. When the cities were hushed in midnight slumber, when every man <span class="pagebreak">[19]</span> had gone to his own house, Christ, our example, would repair to the Mount of Olives, and there, amid the overshadowing trees, would spend the entire night in prayer. He who was Himself without the taint of sin,—a treasure-house of blessing; whose voice was heard in the fourth watch of the night by the terrified disciples upon the stormy sea, in heavenly benediction; and whose word could summon the dead from their graves,—He it was who made supplication with strong crying and tears. He prayed not for Himself, but for those whom He came to save. As He became a suppliant, seeking at the hand of His Father fresh supplies of strength, and coming forth refreshed and invigorated as man’s substitute, He identified Himself with suffering humanity, and gave them an example of the necessity of prayer.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">His nature was without the taint of sin. As the Son of man, He prayed to the Father, showing that human nature requires all the divine support which man can obtain that he may be braced for duty and prepared for trial. As the Prince of Life, He had power with God, and prevailed for His people. This Saviour, who prayed for those that felt no need of prayer, and wept for those that felt no need of tears, is now before the throne, to receive and present to His Father the petitions of those for whom He prayed on earth. The example of Christ is for us to follow. Prayer is a necessity in our labor for the salvation of souls. God alone can give the increase of the seed we sow.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="GW 28.1">Gospel Workers, 28, 29</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Jesus urged the necessity of prayer</strong>—He [Jesus] urged upon men the necessity of prayer, repentance, confession, and the abandonment of sin. He taught them honesty, forbearance, mercy, and compassion, enjoining upon them to love not only those who loved them, but those who hated them, who treated them despitefully. In this He was revealing to them the character of the Father, who is long-suffering, merciful, and gracious, slow to anger, and full of goodness and truth.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="CE 74.1">Christian Education, 74</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer a necessity to daniel</strong>—Daniel was subjected to the severest temptations that can assail the youth of today; yet he was <span class="pagebreak">[20]</span> true to the religious instruction received in early life. He was surrounded with influences calculated to subvert those who would vacillate between principle and inclination; yet the word of God presents him as a faultless character. Daniel dared not trust to his own moral power. Prayer was to him a necessity. He made God his strength, and the fear of God was continually before him in all the transactions of his life.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="FE 78.1">Fundamentals of Christian Education, 78</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Spiritual advance depends on prayer</strong>—If there were more praying among us, more exercise of a living faith, and less dependence upon some one else to have an experience for us, we would be far in advance of where we are today in spiritual intelligence. What we need is a deep, individual heart and soul experience. Then we shall be able to tell what God is doing and how He is working. We need to have a living experience in the things of God; and we are not safe unless we have this. There are some who have a good experience, and they tell you about it; but when you come to weigh it up, you see that it is not a correct experience, for it is not in accordance with a plain Thus saith the Lord. If ever there was a time in our history when we needed to humble our individual souls before God, it is today. We need to come to God with faith in all that is promised in the Word, and then walk in all the light and power that God gives.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="RH 7-1-1909">The Review and Herald, July 1, 1909</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer needed daily</strong>—Religion must begin with emptying and purifying the heart, and must be nurtured by daily prayer.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="4T 535.1">Testimonies for the Church 4:535</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">It is just as convenient, just as essential, for us to pray three times a day as it was for Daniel. Prayer is the life of the soul, the foundation of spiritual growth. In your home, before your family, and before your workmen, you should testify to this truth. And when you are privileged to meet with your brethren in the church, tell them of the necessity of keeping open the channel of communication between God and the soul. Tell them that if they will find heart and voice to pray, God will find answers to their prayers. <span class="pagebreak">[21]</span> Tell them not to neglect their religious duties. Exhort the brethren to pray. We must seek if we would find, we must ask if we would receive, we must knock if we would have the door opened unto us.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="ST 2-10-1890">The Signs of the Times, February 10, 1890</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">In the service of the Jewish priesthood we are continually reminded of the sacrifice and intercession of Christ. All who come to Christ today are to remember that His merit is the incense that mingles with the prayers of those who repent of their sins and receive pardon and mercy and grace. Our need of Christ’s intercession is constant. Day by day, morning and evening, the humble heart needs to offer up prayers to which will be returned answers of grace and peace and joy. “By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name. But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifice God is well pleased.”(<span class="egw-eng" title="6BC 1078.1">SDA Bible Commentary 6:1078</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Like the patriarchs of old, those who profess to love God should erect an altar to the Lord wherever they pitch their tent. If ever there was a time when every house should be a house of prayer, it is now. Fathers and mothers should often lift up their hearts to God in humble supplication for themselves and their children. Let the father, as priest of the household, lay upon the altar of God the morning and evening sacrifice, while the wife and children unite in prayer and praise. In such a household Jesus will love to tarry.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">From every Christian home a holy light should shine forth. Love should be revealed in action. It should flow out in all home intercourse, showing itself in thoughtful kindness, in gentle, unselfish courtesy. There are homes where this principle is carried out—homes where God is worshiped and truest love reigns. From these homes morning and evening prayer ascends to God as sweet incense, and His mercies and blessings descend upon the suppliants like the morning dew.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="PP 144.1">Patriarchs and Prophets, 144</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">In following Christ, looking unto Him who is the Author And Finisher of your faith, you will feel that you are working under <span class="pagebreak">[22]</span> His eye, that you are influenced by His presence, and that He knows your motives. At every step you will humbly inquire: Will this please Jesus? Will it glorify God? Morning and evening your earnest prayers should ascend to God for His blessing and guidance. True prayer takes hold upon Omnipotence and gives us the victory. Upon his knees the Christian obtains strength to resist temptation.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="4T 615.1">Testimonies for the Church 4:615, 616</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">As the priests’ morning and evening entered the holy place at the time of incense, the daily sacrifice was ready to be offered upon the altar in the court without. This was a time of intense interest to the worshipers who assembled at the tabernacle. Before entering into the presence of God through the ministration of the priest, they were to engage in earnest searching of heart and confession of sin. They united in silent prayer, with their faces toward the holy place. Thus their petitions ascended with the cloud of incense, while faith laid hold upon the merits of the promised Saviour prefigured by the atoning sacrifice. The hours appointed for the morning and the evening sacrifice were regarded as sacred, and they came to be observed as the set time for worship throughout the Jewish nation. And when in later times the Jews were scattered as captives in distant lands, they still at the appointed hour turned their faces toward Jerusalem and offered up their petitions to the God of Israel. In this custom Christians have an example for morning and evening prayer. While God condemns a mere round of ceremonies, without the spirit of worship, He looks with great pleasure upon those who love Him, bowing morning and evening to seek pardon for sins committed and to present their requests for needed blessings.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="PP 353.1">Patriarchs and Prophets, 353, 354</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer connects us to heaven</strong>—Those who will put on the whole armor of God and devote some time every day to meditation and prayer and to the study of the Scriptures will be connected with heaven and will have a saving, transforming influence upon those around them. Great thoughts, noble aspirations, clear perceptions of truth and duty to God, will be theirs. They will be yearning for <span class="pagebreak">[23]</span> purity, for light, for love, for all the graces of heavenly birth. Their earnest prayers will enter into that within the veil. This class will have a sanctified boldness to come into the presence of the Infinite One. They will feel that heaven’s light and glories are for them, and they will become refined, elevated, ennobled by this intimate acquaintance with God. Such is the privilege of true Christians.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="5T 112.1">Testimonies for the Church 5:112, 113</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer to be first activity of the day</strong>—Consecrate yourself to God in the morning; make this your very first work. Let your prayer be, “Take me, O Lord, as wholly Thine. I lay all my plans at Thy feet. Use me today in Thy service. Abide with me, and let all my work be wrought in Thee.” This is a daily matter. Each morning consecrate yourself to God for that day. Surrender all your plans to Him, to be carried out or given up as His providence shall indicate. Thus day by day you may be giving your life into the hands of God, and thus your life will be molded more and more after the life of Christ.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="SC 70.1">Steps to Christ, 70</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">The very first out-breathing of the soul in the morning should be for the presence of Jesus. “Without Me,” He says, “ye can do nothing.” It is Jesus that we need; His light, His life, His spirit, must be ours continually. We need Him every hour. And we should pray in the morning that as the sun illuminates the landscape, and fills the world with light, so the Sun of Righteousness may shine into the chambers of mind and heart, and make us all light in the Lord. We cannot do without His presence one moment. The enemy knows when we undertake to do without our Lord, and he is there, ready to fill our minds with his evil suggestions that we may fall from our steadfastness; but it is the desire of the Lord that from moment to moment we should abide in Him, and thus be complete in Him.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="ML 15.1">My Life Today, 15</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer is a duty</strong>—Nothing tends more to promote health of body and of soul than does a spirit of gratitude and praise. It is a positive duty to resist melancholy, discontented thoughts and feelings—as much a duty as it is to pray.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MH 251.1">The Ministry of Healing, 251</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[24]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer most needed when we least feel like praying</strong>—When we feel the least inclined to commune with Jesus, let us pray the most. By so doing we shall break Satan’s snare, the clouds of darkness will disappear, and we shall realize the sweet presence of Jesus.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="LHU 372.1">Lift Him Up, 372</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Darkness encloses those who neglect prayer</strong>—If the Saviour of men, the Son of God, felt the need of prayer, how much more should feeble, sinful mortals feel the necessity of fervent, constant prayer.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Our heavenly Father waits to bestow upon us the fullness of His blessing. It is our privilege to drink largely at the fountain of boundless love. What a wonder it is that we pray so little! God is ready and willing to hear the sincere prayer of the humblest of His children, and yet there is much manifest reluctance on our part to make known our wants to God. What can the angels of heaven think of poor helpless human beings, who are subject to temptation, when God’s heart of infinite love yearns toward them, ready to give them more than they can ask or think, and yet they pray so little and have so little faith? The angels love to bow before God; they love to be near Him. They regard communion with God as their highest joy; and yet the children of earth, who need so much the help that God only can give, seem satisfied to walk without the light of His Spirit, the companionship of His presence.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">The darkness of the evil one encloses those who neglect to pray. The whispered temptations of the enemy entice them to sin; and it is all because they do not make use of the privileges that God has given them in the divine appointment of prayer. Why should the sons and daughters of God be reluctant to pray, when prayer is the key in the hand of faith to unlock heaven’s storehouse, where are treasured the boundless resources of Omnipotence?—(<span class="egw-eng" title="SC 94.2">Steps to Christ, 94</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Avoid neglecting prayer</strong>—Watch, brethren, the first dimming of your light, the first neglect of prayer, the first symptom of <span class="pagebreak">[25]</span> spiritual slumber.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="4T 124.1">Testimonies for the Church 4:124</span>)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">You need to watch, lest the busy activities of life lead you to neglect prayer when you most need the strength prayer would give. Godliness is in danger of being crowded out of the soul through over-devotion to business. It is a great evil to defraud the soul of the strength and heavenly wisdom which are waiting your demand. You need that illumination which God alone can give. No one is fitted to transact his business unless he has this wisdom.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="5T 560.1">Testimonies for the Church 5:560</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Satan deceives those who do not pray</strong>—All who do not earnestly search the Scriptures and submit every desire and purpose of life to that unerring test, all who do not seek God in prayer for a knowledge of His will, will surely wander from the right path and fall under the deception of Satan.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="5T 192.1">Testimonies for the Church 5:192</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Temptation makes prayer a necessity</strong>—The strength acquired in prayer to God, united with individual effort in training the mind to thoughtfulness and caretaking, prepares the person for daily duties and keeps the spirit in peace under all circumstances, however trying. The temptations to which we are daily exposed make prayer a necessity. In order that we may be kept by the power of God through faith, the desires of the mind should be continually ascending in silent prayer for help, for light, for strength, for knowledge. But thought and prayer cannot take the place of earnest, faithful improvement of the time. Work and prayer are both required in perfecting Christian character.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">We must live a twofold life—a life of thought and action, of silent prayer and earnest work.... God requires us to be living epistles, known and read of all men. The soul that turns to God for its strength, its support, its power, by daily, earnest prayer, will have noble aspirations, clear perceptions of truth and duty, lofty purposes of action, and a continual hungering and thirsting after righteousness.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="AG 317.1">God’s Amazing Grace, 317</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[26]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer needed now more than in the early days</strong>—We must be much in prayer if we would make progress in the divine life. When the message of truth was first proclaimed, how much we prayed. How often was the voice of intercession heard in the chamber, in the barn, in the orchard, or the grove. Frequently we spent hours in earnest prayer, two or three together claiming the promise; often the sound of weeping was heard and then the voice of thanksgiving and the song of praise. Now the day of God is nearer than when we first believed, and we should be more earnest, more zealous, and fervent than in those early days. Our perils are greater now than then. Souls are more hardened. We need now to be imbued with the spirit of Christ, and we should not rest until we receive it.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="5T 161.1">Testimonies for the Church 5:161, 162</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Seek the Lord with all the heart</strong>—Our prayers should be full of tenderness and love. When we yearn for a deeper, broader realization of the Saviour’s love, we shall cry to God for more wisdom. If ever there was a need of soul-stirring prayers and sermons, it is now. The end of all things is at hand. O that we could see as we should the necessity of seeking the Lord with all the heart! Then we should find Him. May God teach His people how to pray.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="AG 92.1">God’s Amazing Grace, 92</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer is not time wasted</strong>—Every morning take time to begin your work with prayer. Do not think this wasted time; it is time that will live through eternal ages. By this means success and spiritual victory will be brought in. The machinery will respond to the touch of the Master’s hand. God’s blessing is certainly worth asking for, and the work cannot be done aright unless the beginning is right. The hands of every worker must be strengthened, his heart must be purified, before the Lord can use him effectively.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="7T 194.1">Testimonies for the Church 7:194</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Few appreciate the privilege of prayer</strong>—We should watch and work and pray as though this were the last day that would be <span class="pagebreak">[27]</span> granted us. How intensely earnest, then, would be our life. How closely would we follow Jesus in all our words and deeds.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">There are few who rightly appreciate or improve the precious privilege of prayer. We should go to Jesus and tell Him all our needs. We may bring Him our little cares and perplexities as well as our greater troubles. Whatever arises to disturb or distress us, we should take it to the Lord in prayer. When we feel that we need the presence of Christ at every step, Satan will have little opportunity to intrude his temptations. It is his studied effort to keep us away from our best and most sympathizing friend. We should make no one our confidant but Jesus. We can safely commune with Him of all that is in our hearts.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="5T 200.1">Testimonies for the Church 5:200, 201</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>More prayer needed as the end approaches</strong>—Confederacies will increase in number and power as we draw nearer to the end of time. These confederacies will create opposing influences to the truth, forming new parties of professed believers who will act out their own delusive theories. The apostasy will increase. “Some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils” (<span class="bible-kjv" title="1 Timothy 4:1">1 Timothy 4:1</span>). Men and women have confederated to oppose the Lord God of heaven, and the church is only half awake to the situation. There needs to be much more of prayer, much more of earnest effort, among professed believers.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="2SM 383.1">Selected Messages 2:383</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">If there was ever a time when we should watch and pray in real earnest, it is now. There may be supposable things that appear as good things, and yet they need to be carefully considered with much prayer, for they are specious devices of the enemy to lead souls in a path which lies so close to the path of truth that it will be scarcely distinguishable from the path which leads to holiness and heaven. But the eye of faith may discern that it is diverging from the right path, though almost imperceptibly. At first it may be thought positively right, but after a while it is seen to be widely divergent from the path of safety, from the path which leads to holiness and heaven.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="TM 229.1">Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, 229</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[28]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Victory through daily prayer</strong>—Through daily prayer to God, they will have wisdom and grace from Him to bear the conflicts and stern realities of life, and come off victorious. Fidelity, and serenity of mind, can only be retained by watchfulness and prayer.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MYP 80.1">Messages to Young People, 80</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Victory requires earnest prayer</strong>—The victory is not won without much earnest prayer, without the humbling of self at every step. Our will is not to be forced into cooperation with divine agencies, but it must be voluntarily submitted.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MB 142.1">Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing, 142</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>We must take time to pray</strong>—We should now acquaint ourselves with God by proving His promises. Angels record every prayer that is earnest and sincere. We should rather dispense with selfish gratifications than neglect communion with God. The deepest poverty, the greatest self-denial, with His approval, is better than riches, honors, ease, and friendship without it. We must take time to pray.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="GC 622.1">The Great Controversy, 622</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Spend much time in prayer</strong>—Let much time be spent in prayer and close searching of the word. Let all obtain the real facts of faith in their own souls through belief that the Holy Spirit will be imparted to them because they have a real hungering and thirsting after righteousness.... Let there be more praying, believing, and receiving, and more working together with God.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="6T 65.1">Testimonies for the Church 6:65, 66</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Pray as never before</strong>—Look unto Jesus in simplicity and faith. Gaze upon Jesus until the spirit faints under the excess of light. We do not half pray. We do not half believe. “Ask, and it shall be given you.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Luke 11:9">Luke 11:9</span>. Pray, believe, strengthen one another. Pray as you never before prayed that the Lord will lay His hand upon you, that you may be able to comprehend the length and breadth and depth and height, and to know the love of Christ, <span class="pagebreak">[29]</span> which passeth knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="7T 214.1">Testimonies for the Church 7:214</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Pray, yes, pray as you have never prayed before, that you may not be deluded by Satan’s devices, that you may not be given up to a heedless, careless, vain spirit, and attend to religious duties to quiet your own conscience.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="2T 144.1">Testimonies for the Church 2:144</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Pray always</strong>—“Pray always;” that is, be ever in the spirit of prayer, and then you will be in readiness for your Lord’s coming.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="5T 235.1">Testimonies for the Church 5:235</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Need of much prayer</strong>—There is now need of much prayer. Christ commands, “Pray without ceasing;” that is, keep the mind uplifted to God, the source of all power and efficiency.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="TM 510.1">Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, 510</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Activity no substitute for prayer</strong>—As activity increases and men become successful in doing any work for God, there is danger of trusting to human plans and methods. There is a tendency to pray less, and to have less faith. Like the disciples, we are in danger of losing sight of our dependence on God, and seeking to make a savior of our activity. We need to look constantly to Jesus, realizing that it is His power which does the work. While we are to labor earnestly for the salvation of the lost, we must also take time for meditation, for prayer, and for the study of the word of God. Only the work accomplished with much prayer, and sanctified by the merit of Christ, will in the end prove to have been efficient for good.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="DA 362.1">The Desire of Ages, 362</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer needed to take unpopular stands</strong>—It takes moral courage, firmness, decision, perseverance, and very much prayer to step out on the unpopular side. We are thankful that we can come to Christ as the poor suffering ones came to Christ in the temple.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="Ev 240.1">Evangelism, 240</span>). <span class="pagebreak">[30]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer needed to do God’s work</strong>—Much prayer and the most vigorous exercise of the mind are necessary if we would be prepared to do the work which God would entrust to us. Many never attain to the position which they might occupy, because they wait for God to do for them that which He has given them power to do for themselves. All who are fitted for usefulness in this life must be trained by the severest mental and moral discipline, and then God will assist them by combining divine power with human effort.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="4T 611.1">Testimonies for the Church 4:611</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer needed to understand truth</strong>—The themes of redemption are momentous themes, and only those who are spiritually minded can discern their depth and significance. It is our safety, our life, our joy, to dwell upon the truths of the plan of salvation. Faith and prayer are necessary in order that we may behold the deep things of God. Our minds are so bound about with narrow ideas, that we catch but limited views of the experience it is our privilege to have. How little do we comprehend what is meant by the prayer of the apostle, when he says, “That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God. Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.”(<span class="egw-eng" title="RH 11-17-1891">The Review and Herald, November 17, 1891</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer needed in the home</strong>—Affection cannot be lasting, even in the home circle, unless there is a conformity of the will and disposition to the will of God. All the faculties and passions are to be brought into harmony with the attributes of Jesus Christ. If the father and mother in the love and fear of God unite their <span class="pagebreak">[31]</span> interests to have authority in the home, they will see the necessity of much prayer, much sober reflection. And as they seek God, their eyes will be opened to see heavenly messengers present to protect them in answer to the prayer of faith. They will overcome the weaknesses of their character and go on unto perfection.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="AH 315.1">The Adventist Home, 315, 316</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer needed to maintain connection with God</strong>—Neglect the exercise of prayer, or engage in prayer spasmodically, now and then, as it is deemed convenient, and you lose your connection with God. The Christian life becomes dry, and the spiritual faculties have no vitality. The religious experience lacks health and vigor.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="ST 7-31-1893">The Signs of the Times, July 31, 1893</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer needed for spiritual strength</strong>—The reason why some are restless is, that they do not go to the only true source for happiness. They are ever trying to find out of Christ that enjoyment which is found alone in Him. In Him are no disappointed hopes. Oh how is the precious privilege of prayer neglected! The reading of the word of God prepares the mind for prayer. One of the greatest reasons why many have so little disposition to draw near to God by prayer is, that they have unfitted themselves for this sacred work by reading fascinating stories, which have excited the imagination and aroused unholy passions. The word of God becomes distasteful; the hour of prayer is not thought of. Prayer is the strength of the Christian. When alone, he is not alone; he feels the presence of One who has said, “Lo, I am with you alway.”(<span class="egw-eng" title="RH 3-11-1880">The Review and Herald, March 11, 1880</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer needed to enter heaven</strong>—There is no such thing as our entering the heavenly portals through indulgence and folly, amusement, selfishness, but only by constant watchfulness and unceasing prayer. Spiritual vigilance on our part individually is the price of safety. Swerve not to Satan’s side a single inch, lest he gain advantage over you.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="6BC 1094.1">The S.D.A. Bible Commentary 6:1094</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[32]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer keeps us faithful</strong>—Without unceasing prayer and diligent watching, we are in danger of growing careless, and of deviating from the right path. The adversary seeks continually to obstruct the way to the mercy-seat, that we may not by earnest supplication and faith obtain grace and power to resist temptation.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="RH 12-8-1904">The Review and Herald, December 8, 1904</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Pray for the spirit</strong>—If we are to learn of Christ, we must pray as the apostles prayed when the Holy Spirit was poured upon them. We need a baptism of the Spirit of God. We are not safe for one hour while we are failing to render obedience to the Word of God.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="FE 537.1">Fundamentals of Christian Education, 537</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Weakness turned to strength through prayer</strong>—They [many of God’s people] do not see the importance of self-knowledge and self-control. They do not watch and pray, lest they enter into temptation. If they would watch, they would become acquainted with their weak points, where they are most likely to be assailed by temptation. With watchfulness and prayer their weakest points can be so guarded as to become their strongest points, and they can encounter temptation without being overcome. Every follower of Christ should daily examine himself, that he may become perfectly acquainted with his own conduct.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="2T 511.1">Testimonies for the Church 2:511</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Pray in all circumstances</strong>—In your business, in companionship for leisure hours, and in alliance for life, let all the associations you form be entered upon with earnest, humble prayer. You will thus show that you honor God, and God will honor you. Pray when you are fainthearted. When you are desponding, close the lips firmly to men; do not shadow the path of others; but tell everything to Jesus. Reach up your hands for help. In your weakness lay hold of infinite strength. Ask for humility, wisdom, courage, increase of faith, that you may see light in God’s light and rejoice in His love.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MH 513.1">The Ministry of Healing, 513</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[33]</span> </p>
