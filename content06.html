	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer is heaven’s means of success in overcoming sin</strong>—There are many who, though striving to obey God’s commandments, have little peace or joy. This lack in their experience is the result of a failure to exercise faith. They walk as it were in a salt land, a parched wilderness. They claim little, when they might claim much; for there is no limit to the promises of God. Such ones do not correctly represent the sanctification that comes through obedience to the truth. The Lord would have all His sons and daughters happy, peaceful, and obedient. Through the exercise of faith the believer comes into possession of these blessings. Through faith, every deficiency of character may be supplied, every defilement cleansed, every fault corrected, every excellence developed.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Prayer is heaven’s ordained means of success in the conflict with sin and the development of Christian character. The divine influences that come in answer to the prayer of faith will accomplish in the soul of the suppliant all for which he pleads. For the pardon of sin, for the Holy Spirit, for a Christlike temper, for wisdom and strength to do His work, for any gift He has promised, <span class="pagebreak">[53]</span> we may ask; and the promise is, “Ye shall receive.”(<span class="egw-eng" title="AA 563.1">The Acts of the Apostles, 563, 564</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>God longs to do great things for us</strong>—Our part is to pray and believe. Watch unto prayer. Watch, and co-operate with the prayer-hearing God. Bear in mind that “we are labourers together with God.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="1 Corinthians 3:9">1 Corinthians 3:9</span>. Speak and act in harmony with your prayers. It will make an infinite difference with you whether trial shall prove your faith to be genuine, or show that your prayers are only a form.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">When perplexities arise, and difficulties confront you, look not for help to humanity. Trust all with God. The practice of telling our difficulties to others only makes us weak, and brings no strength to them. It lays upon them the burden of our spiritual infirmities, which they cannot relieve. We seek the strength of erring, finite man, when we might have the strength of the unerring, infinite God.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">You need not go to the ends of the earth for wisdom, for God is near. It is not the capabilities you now possess or ever will have that will give you success. It is that which the Lord can do for you. We need to have far less confidence in what man can do and far more confidence in what God can do for every believing soul. He longs to have you reach after Him by faith. He longs to have you expect great things from Him. He longs to give you understanding in temporal as well as in spiritual matters. He can sharpen the intellect. He can give tact and skill. Put your talents into the work, ask God for wisdom, and it will be given you.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="COL 146.1">Christ’s Object Lessons, 146</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer and faith will do wonderful things</strong>—I fear that there is not that faith that is essential. Shall we not brace ourselves against disappointments and temptations to be discouraged? God is merciful, and with the truth rejoicing, purifying, ennobling the life, we can do a sound and solid work for God. Prayer and faith will do wonderful things. The Word must be our weapon of warfare. Miracles can be wrought through the Word; for it is profitable for all things.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="Ev 489.1">Evangelism, 489</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[54]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Faith to be mixed with our prayers</strong>—The people of God must move understandingly. They should not be satisfied until every known sin is confessed; then it is their privilege and duty to believe that Jesus accepts them. They must not wait for others to press through the darkness and obtain the victory for them to enjoy. Such enjoyment will last only till the meeting closes. But God must be served from principle instead of from feeling. Morning and night obtain the victory for yourselves in your own family. Let not your daily labor keep you from this. Take time to pray, and as you pray, believe that God hears you. Have faith mixed with your prayers. You may not at all times feel the immediate answer; but then it is that faith is tried. You are proved to see whether you will trust in God, whether you have living, abiding faith. “Faithful is He that calleth you, who also will do it.” Walk the narrow plank of faith. Trust all on the promises of the Lord. Trust God in darkness. That is the time to have faith. But you often let feeling govern you. You look for worthiness in yourselves when you do not feel comforted by the Spirit of God, and despair because you cannot find it. You do not trust enough in Jesus, precious Jesus. You do not make His worthiness to be all, all. The very best you can do will not merit the favor of God. It is Jesus’ worthiness that will save you, His blood that will cleanse you. But you have efforts to make. You must do what you can on your part. Be zealous and repent, then believe.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Confound not faith and feeling together. They are distinct. Faith is ours to exercise. This faith we must keep in exercise. Believe, believe. Let your faith take hold of the blessing, and it is yours. Your feelings have nothing to do with this faith. When faith brings the blessing to your heart, and you rejoice in the blessing, it is no more faith, but feeling.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="1T 167.1">Testimonies for the Church 1:167</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer and faith lay hold of God’s power</strong>—True faith and true prayer—how strong they are! They are as two arms by which the human suppliant lays hold upon the power of Infinite Love. <span class="pagebreak">[55]</span> Faith is trusting in God,—believing that He loves us, and knows what is for our best good. Thus, instead of our own way, it leads us to choose His way. In place of our ignorance, it accepts His wisdom; in place of our weakness, His strength; in place of our sinfulness, His righteousness. Our lives, ourselves, are already His; faith acknowledges His ownership, and accepts its blessings. Truth, uprightness, purity, are pointed out as secrets of life’s success. It is faith that puts us in possession of these. Every good impulse or aspiration is the gift of God; faith receives from God the life that alone can produce true growth and efficiency.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="GW 259.1">Gospel Workers, 259</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Our lives are to be in harmony with our petitions</strong>—Pray in faith. And be sure to bring your lives into harmony with your petitions, that you may receive the blessings for which you pray. Let not your faith weaken, for the blessings received are proportionate to the faith exercised. “According to your faith be it unto you.”“All things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Matthew 9:29">Matthew 9:29</span>; <span class="bible-kjv" title="Matthew 21:22">Matthew 21:22</span>. Pray, believe, rejoice. Sing praises to God because He has answered your prayers. Take Him at His word. “He is faithful that promised.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Hebrews 10:23">Hebrews 10:23</span>. Not one sincere supplication is lost. The channel is open; the stream is flowing. It carries with it healing properties, pouring forth a restoring current of life and health and salvation.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="7T 274.1">Testimonies for the Church 7:274</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>God accepts the prayer of faith</strong>—The humble, intelligent prayer of faith, that comes from unfeigned lips, is wholly acceptable to God. It is the heart-felt prayer that is heard in heaven and rewarded by an answer on earth. “But to this man will I look, even to him that is poor, and of a contrite spirit, and that trembleth at my word.”“For thus saith the high and lofty One, that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and a humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite <span class="pagebreak">[56]</span> ones.”“The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.”(<span class="egw-eng" title="ST 12-3-1896">The Signs of the Times, December 3, 1896</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Press your petitions in faith</strong>—God will be to us everything we will let Him be. Our languid, halfhearted prayers will not bring us returns from heaven. Oh, we need to press our petitions! Ask in faith, wait in faith, receive in faith, rejoice in hope, for everyone that seeketh findeth. Be in earnest in the matter. Seek God with all the heart. People put soul and earnestness into everything they undertake in temporal things, until their efforts are crowned with success. With intense earnestness learn the trade of seeking the rich blessings that God has promised, and with persevering, determined effort you shall have His light and His truth and His rich grace.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">In sincerity, in soul hunger, cry after God. Wrestle with the heavenly agencies until you have the victory. Put your whole being into the Lord’s hands, soul, body, and spirit, and resolve to be His loving, consecrated agency, moved by His will, controlled by His mind, infused by His Spirit.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Tell Jesus your wants in the sincerity of your soul. You are not required to hold a long controversy with, or preach a sermon to, God, but with a heart of sorrow for your sins, say, “Save me, Lord, or I perish.” There is hope for such souls. They will seek, they will ask, they will knock, and they will find. When Jesus has taken away the burden of sin that is crushing the soul, you will experience the blessedness of the peace of Christ.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="OHC 131.1">Our High Calling, 131</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>God answers the prayer of faith with power</strong>—When men are as devoted as Elijah was and possess the faith that he had, God will reveal Himself as He did then. When men plead with the Lord as did Jacob, the results that were seen then will again be seen. Power will come from God in answer to the prayer of faith.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="GW 255.1">Gospel Workers, 255</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[57]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-noindent"><strong>Understand the science of prayer</strong>—Prayer and faith are closely allied, and they need to be studied together. In the prayer of faith there is a divine science; it is a science that everyone who would make his lifework a success must understand. Christ says, “What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Mark 11:24">Mark 11:24</span>. He makes it plain that our asking must be according to God’s will; we must ask for the things that He has promised, and whatever we receive must be used in doing His will. The conditions met, the promise is unequivocal.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">For the pardon of sin, for the Holy Spirit, for a Christlike temper, for wisdom and strength to do His work, for any gift He has promised, we may ask; then we are to believe that we receive, and return thanks to God that we have received.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="Ed 257.1">Education, 257, 258</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Private prayers sustain the soul life</strong>—We need look for no outward evidence of the blessing. The gift is in the promise, and we may go about our work assured that what God has promised He is able to perform, and that the gift, which we already possess, will be realized when we need it most.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">To live thus by the word of God means the surrender to Him of the whole life. There will be felt a continual sense of need and dependence, a drawing out of the heart after God. Prayer is a necessity; for it is the life of the soul. Family prayer, public prayer, have their place; but it is secret communion with God that sustains the soul life.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">It was in the mount with God that Moses beheld the pattern of that wonderful building which was to be the abiding place of His glory. It is in the mount with God—in the secret place of communion—that we are to contemplate His glorious ideal for humanity. Thus we shall be enabled so to fashion our character building that to us may be fulfilled His promise, “I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="2 Corinthians 6:16">2 Corinthians 6:16</span>. <span class="pagebreak">[58]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-indented">It was in hours of solitary prayer that Jesus in His earth life received wisdom and power. Let the youth follow His example in finding at dawn and twilight a quiet season for communion with their Father in heaven. And throughout the day let them lift up their hearts to God. At every step of our way He says, “I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand,?Fear not; I will help thee.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Isaiah 41:13">Isaiah 41:13</span>. Could our children learn these lessons in the morning of their years, what freshness and power, what joy and sweetness, would be brought into their lives!—(<span class="egw-eng" title="Ed 258.1">Education, 258, 259</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Asking in faith brings rich blessings</strong>—In the words we speak to the people and in the prayers we offer, God desires us to give unmistakable evidence that we have spiritual life. We do not enjoy the fullness of blessing which the Lord has prepared for us, because we do not ask in faith. If we would exercise faith in the word of the living God we should have the richest blessings. We dishonor God by our lack of faith; therefore we can not impart life to others by bearing a living, uplifting testimony. We cannot give that which we do not possess.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="6T 63.1">Testimonies for the Church 6:63</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Ask in faith; then receive</strong>—There is strength to be obtained of God. He can help. He can give grace and heavenly wisdom. If you ask in faith, you will receive; but you must watch unto prayer. Watch, pray, work, should be your watchword.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="2T 427.1">Testimonies for the Church 2:427</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Faith claims the blessing before it is realized and felt</strong>—I have frequently seen that the children of the Lord neglect prayer, especially secret prayer, altogether too much; that many do not exercise that faith which it is their privilege and duty to exercise, often waiting for that feeling which faith alone can bring. Feeling is not faith; the two are distinct. Faith is ours to exercise, but joyful feeling and the blessing are God’s to give. The grace of God comes to the soul through the channel of living faith, and that faith it is in our power to exercise. <span class="pagebreak">[59]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-noindent">True faith lays hold of and claims the promised blessing before it is realized and felt. We must send up our petitions in faith within the second veil and let our faith take hold of the promised blessing and claim it as ours. We are then to believe that we receive the blessing, because our faith has hold of it, and according to the Word it is ours. “What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Mark 11:24">Mark 11:24</span>. Here is faith, naked faith, to believe that we receive the blessing, even before we realize it. When the promised blessing is realized and enjoyed, faith is swallowed up. But many suppose they have much faith when sharing largely of the Holy Spirit and that they cannot have faith unless they feel the power of the Spirit. Such confound faith with the blessing that comes through faith. The very time to exercise faith is when we feel destitute of the Spirit. When thick clouds of darkness seem to hover over the mind, then is the time to let living faith pierce the darkness and scatter the clouds. True faith rests on the promises contained in the Word of God, and those only who obey that Word can claim its glorious promises. “If ye abide in Me, and My words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="John 15:7">John 15:7</span>. “Whatsoever we ask, we receive of Him, because we keep His commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in His sight.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="1 John 3:22">1 John 3:22</span>.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="EW 72.1">Early Writings, 72, 73</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Do not falter if no immediate answer is given</strong>—Your faith must not let go of the promises of God, if you do not see or feel the immediate answer to your prayers. Be not afraid to trust God. Rely upon His sure promise: “Ask, and ye shall receive.” God is too wise to err, and too good to withhold any good thing from His saints that walk uprightly.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="1T 120.1">Testimonies for the Church 1:120</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Pray; then leave the results with God</strong>—Work in faith, and leave results with God. Pray in faith, and the mystery of His providence will bring its answer. At times it may seem that you cannot succeed. But work and believe, putting into your efforts <span class="pagebreak">[60]</span> faith, hope, and courage. After doing what you can, wait for the Lord, declaring His faithfulness, and He will bring His word to pass. Wait, not in fretful anxiety, but in undaunted faith and unshaken trust.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="7T 245.1">Testimonies for the Church 7:245</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Pray with confidence</strong>—It is the heartfelt prayer of faith that is heard in heaven and answered on earth. God understands the needs of humanity. He knows what we desire before we ask Him. He sees the soul’s conflict with doubt and temptation. He marks the sincerity of the suppliant. He will accept the humiliation and affliction of the soul. “To this man will I look,” He declares, “even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.”</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">It is our privilege to pray with confidence, the Spirit inditing our petitions. With simplicity we should state our needs to the Lord, and claim His promise.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="AG 92.1">God’s Amazing Grace, 92</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Jesus is as willing to listen to prayer today as when he was on earth</strong>—Worldly wisdom teaches that prayer is not essential. Men of science claim that there can be no real answer to prayer; that this would be a violation of law, a miracle, and that miracles have no existence. The universe, say they, is governed by fixed laws, and God Himself does nothing contrary to these laws. Thus they represent God as bound by His own laws—as if the operation of divine laws could exclude divine freedom. Such teaching is opposed to the testimony of the Scriptures. Were not miracles wrought by Christ and His apostles? The same compassionate Saviour lives today, and He is as willing to listen to the prayer of faith as when He walked visibly among men.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="GC 525.1">The Great Controversy, 525</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>The prayer of faith expresses the simple wants of the soul</strong>—Prayer is not an expiation for sin; it has no virtue or merit of itself. All the flowery words at our command are not equivalent to one holy desire. The most eloquent prayers are but idle words if they do not express the true sentiments of the heart. But the prayer that comes <span class="pagebreak">[61]</span> from an earnest heart, when the simple wants of the soul are expressed, as we would ask an earthly friend for a favor, expecting it to be granted—this is the prayer of faith. God does not desire our ceremonial compliments, but the unspoken cry of the heart broken and subdued with a sense of its sin and utter weakness finds its way to the Father of all mercy.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MB 86.1">Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing, 86, 87</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer moves God to action</strong>—By your fervent prayers of faith you can move the arm that moves the world. You can teach your children to pray effectually as they kneel by your side. Let your prayers arise to the throne of God, “Spare thy people, O Lord, and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God?” God is at work. He doeth wonders, and although He is high and lifted up, prayer can reach His throne. He that is turning and overturning, He that can do marvelous things, will regard the contrite prayer of faith from the humblest of His children.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="RH 4-23-1889">The Review and Herald, April 23, 1889</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>God cannot answer prayers that are not asked</strong>—Prayer and faith will do what no power on earth can accomplish. We are seldom, in all respects, placed in the same position twice. We continually have new scenes and new trials to pass through, where past experience cannot be a sufficient guide. We must have the continual light that comes from God. Christ is ever sending messages to those who listen for His voice.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">It is a part of God’s plan to grant us, in answer to the prayer of faith, that which He would not bestow did we not thus ask.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="ML 15.1">My Life Today, 15</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Ministers to be untiring in prayer</strong>—Ministers should seek a heart preparation before entering upon the work of helping others, for the people are far in advance of many of the ministers. They should untiringly wrestle in prayer until the Lord blesses <span class="pagebreak">[62]</span> them. When the love of God is burning on the altar of their hearts, they will not preach to exhibit their own smartness, but to present Christ who taketh away the sins of the world.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="5T 166.1">Testimonies for the Church 5:166</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>The remedy for discouragement is faith, prayer, and work</strong>—For all who are disheartened there is but one remedy,—faith, prayer, and work.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="6T 438.1">Testimonies for the Church 6:438</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer is the weapon by which we resist the enemy</strong>—Christ is our only hope. Come to God in the name of Him who gave His life for the life of the world. Rely upon the efficacy of His sacrifice. Show that His love, His joy, is in your soul, and that because of this, your joy is full. In God is our strength. Pray much. Prayer is the life of the soul. The prayer of faith is the weapon by which we may successfully resist every assault of the enemy.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="ST 8-24-1904">The Signs of the Times, August 24, 1904</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer not lost, even if not answered as we expect</strong>—The prayer of faith is never lost; but to claim that it will be always answered in the very way and for the particular thing we have expected, is presumption.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="1T 231.1">Testimonies for the Church 1:231</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>The comforter comes in answer to the prayer of faith</strong>—At all times and in all places, in all sorrows and in all afflictions, when the outlook seems dark and the future perplexing, and we feel helpless and alone, the Comforter will be sent in answer to the prayer of faith. Circumstances may separate us from every earthly friend; but no circumstance, no distance, can separate us from the heavenly Comforter. Wherever we are, wherever we may go, He is always at our right hand to support, sustain, uphold, and cheer.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="DA 669.1">The Desire of Ages, 669, 670</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Angels carry our prayers to the heavenly sanctuary</strong>—Angels hear the offering of praise and the prayer of faith, and they <span class="pagebreak">[63]</span> bear the petitions to Him who ministers in the sanctuary for His people, and pleads His merits in their behalf. True prayer takes hold upon Omnipotence, and gives men the victory. Upon his knees the Christian obtains strength to resist temptation.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="RH 2-1-1912">The Review and Herald, February 1, 1912</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Earnest prayer will baffle Satan’s strongest efforts</strong>—Man is Satan’s captive and is naturally inclined to follow his suggestions and do his bidding. He has in himself no power to oppose effectual resistance to evil. It is only as Christ abides in him by living faith, influencing his desires and strengthening him with strength from above, that man may venture to face so terrible a foe. Every other means of defense is utterly vain. It is only through Christ that Satan’s power is limited. This is a momentous truth that all should understand. Satan is busy every moment, going to and fro, walking up and down in the earth, seeking whom he may devour. But the earnest prayer of faith will baffle his strongest efforts. Then take “the shield of faith,” brethren, “wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.”(<span class="egw-eng" title="5T 294.1">Testimonies for the Church 5:294</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>The prayer of faith prevails against Satan</strong>—The prayer of faith is the great strength of the Christian and will assuredly prevail against Satan. This is why he insinuates that we have no need of prayer. The name of Jesus, our Advocate, he detests; and when we earnestly come to Him for help, Satan’s host is alarmed. It serves his purpose well if we neglect the exercise of prayer, for then his lying wonders are more readily received.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="1T 296.1">Testimonies for the Church 1:296</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[64]</span> </p>
