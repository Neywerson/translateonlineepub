	<h2 class="chapterhead">Chapter 16—Private Prayer</h2>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Private prayer is essential</strong>—It is impossible for the soul to flourish while prayer is not a special exercise of the mind. Family or public prayer alone is not sufficient. Secret prayer is very important; in solitude the soul is laid bare to the inspecting eye of God, and every motive is scrutinized. Secret prayer! How precious! The soul communing with God! Secret prayer is to be heard only by the prayer-hearing God. No curious ear is to receive the burden of such petitions. In secret prayer the soul is free from surrounding influences, free from excitement. Calmly, yet fervently, will it reach out after God. Secret prayer is frequently perverted, and its sweet designs lost, by loud vocal prayer. Instead of the calm, quiet trust and faith in God, the soul drawn out in low, humble tones, the voice is raised to a loud pitch, and excitement is encouraged, and secret prayer loses its softening, sacred influence. There is a storm of feeling, a storm of words, making it impossible to discern the still, small voice that speaks to the soul while engaged in its secret, true, heartfelt devotion. Secret prayer, properly carried out, is productive of great good. But prayer which is made public to the entire family and neighborhood is not secret prayer, even though thought to be, and divine strength is not received from <span class="pagebreak">[179]</span> it. Sweet and abiding will be the influence emanating from Him who seeth in secret, whose ear is open to answer the prayer arising from the heart. By calm, simple faith the soul holds communion with God and gathers to itself divine rays of light to strengthen and sustain it to endure the conflicts of Satan. God is our tower of strength.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="2T 189.1">Testimonies for the Church 2:189, 190</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Private prayer, family prayer, prayer in public gatherings for the worship of God—all are essential. And we are to live our prayers. We are to co-operate with Christ in His work.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="7T 239.1">Testimonies for the Church 7:239</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>All need to watch and pray continually</strong>—The very beginning of the evil was a neglect of watchfulness and secret prayer, then came a neglect of other religious duties, and thus the way was opened for all the sins that followed. Every Christian will be assailed by the allurements of the world, the clamors of the carnal nature, and the direct temptations of Satan. No one is safe. No matter what our experience has been, no matter how high our station, we need to watch and pray continually. We must be daily controlled by the Spirit of God or we are controlled by Satan.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="5T 102.1">Testimonies for the Church 5:102</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Pray at all times</strong>—Cultivate the habit of talking with the Saviour when you are alone, when you are walking, and when you are busy with your daily labor. Let the heart be continually uplifted in silent petition for help, for light, for strength, for knowledge. Let every breath be a prayer.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="Te 135.1">Temperance, 135</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">The way to the throne of God is always open. You cannot always be on your knees in prayer, but your silent petitions may constantly ascend to God for strength and guidance. When tempted, as you will be, you may flee to the secret place of the Most High. His everlasting arms will be underneath you.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="CH 362.1">Counsels on Health, 362</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[180]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-noindent"><strong>Secret prayer is appropriate anywhere, anytime</strong>—Pray in your closet, and as you go about your daily labor let your heart be often uplifted to God.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">It was thus that Enoch walked with God. These silent prayers rise like precious incense before the throne of grace. Satan cannot overcome him whose heart is thus stayed upon God.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">There is no time or place in which it is inappropriate to offer up a petition to God. There is nothing that can prevent us from lifting up our hearts in the spirit of earnest prayer. In the crowds of the street, in the midst of a business engagement, we may send up a petition to God and plead for divine guidance, as did Nehemiah when he made his request before King Artaxerxes. A closet of communion may be found wherever we are. We should have the door of the heart open continually and our invitation going up that Jesus may come and abide as a heavenly guest in the soul.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="SC 98.1">Steps to Christ, 98, 99</span>).</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer brings us into the presence of God himself</strong>—Prayer, whether offered in the public assembly, at the family altar, or in secret, places man directly in the presence of God. By constant prayer the youth may obtain principles so firm that the most powerful temptations will not draw them from their allegiance to God.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="ML 18.1">My Life Today, 18</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer keeps us connected with Christ</strong>—We should be much in secret prayer. Christ is the vine, ye are the branches. And if we would grow and flourish, we must continually draw sap and nourishment from the Living Vine; for separated from the Vine we have no strength.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">I asked the angel why there was no more faith and power in Israel. He said, “Ye let go of the arm of the Lord too soon. Press your petitions to the throne, and hold on by strong faith. The promises are sure.”(<span class="egw-eng" title="EW 73.1">Early Writings, 73</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Private prayer sustains the soul</strong>—To live thus by the word of God means the surrender to Him of the whole life. There will be <span class="pagebreak">[181]</span> felt a continual sense of need and dependence, a drawing out of the heart after God. Prayer is a necessity; for it is the life of the soul. Family prayer, public prayer, have their place; but it is secret communion with God that sustains the soul life.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="Ed 258.1">Education, 258</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Private prayer is needed in order to become personally acquainted with God</strong>—Oh, do we know God as we should? What comfort, what joy, we should have if we were to learn daily the lessons He desires us to learn! We must know Him by an experimental knowledge. It will be profitable for us to spend more time in secret prayer, in becoming personally acquainted with our heavenly Father.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MM 102.1">Medical Ministry, 102</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>God’s people neglect secret prayer</strong>—I have frequently seen that the children of the Lord neglect prayer, especially secret prayer, altogether too much; that many do not exercise that faith which it is their privilege and duty to exercise, often waiting for that feeling which faith alone can bring. Feeling is not faith; the two are distinct.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="EW 72.1">Early Writings, 72</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Our Creator demands our supreme devotion, our first allegiance. Anything which tends to abate our love for God, or to interfere with the service due Him, becomes thereby an idol. With some their lands, their houses, their merchandise, are the idols. Business enterprises are prosecuted with zeal and energy, while the service of God is made a secondary consideration. Family worship is neglected, secret prayer is forgotten.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="2BC 1011.1">SDA Bible Commentary 2:1011, 1012</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Neglect of prayer is progressive</strong>—Beware how you neglect secret prayer and a study of God’s word. These are your weapons against him who is striving to hinder your progress heavenward. The first neglect of prayer and Bible study makes easier the second neglect. The first resistance to the Spirit’s pleading prepares the way for the second resistance. Thus the heart is hardened, and <span class="pagebreak">[182]</span> the conscience seared.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MYP 96.1">Messages to Young People, 96</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Sporadic prayer will cause you to lose your hold on God</strong>—Prayer is the breath of the soul. It is the secret of spiritual power. No other means of grace can be substituted and the health of the soul be preserved. Prayer brings the heart into immediate contact with the Wellspring of life, and strengthens the sinew and muscle of the religious experience. Neglect the exercise of prayer, or engage in prayer spasmodically, now and then, as seems convenient, and you lose your hold on God. The spiritual faculties lose their vitality, the religious experience lacks health and vigor.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MYP 249.1">Messages to Young People, 249, 250</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Private prayer should be private</strong>—In private prayer all have the privilege of praying as long as they desire and of being as explicit as they please. They can pray for all their relatives and friends. The closet is the place to tell all their private difficulties, and trials, and temptations. A common meeting to worship God is not the place to open the privacies of the heart.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="2T 578.1">Testimonies for the Church 2:578</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">In secret devotion our prayers are to reach the ears of none but the prayer-hearing God. No curious ear is to receive the burden of such petitions.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">“When thou prayest, enter into thy closet.” Have a place for secret prayer. Jesus had select places for communion with God, and so should we. We need often to retire to some spot, however humble, where we can be alone with God.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">“Pray to thy Father which is in secret.” In the name of Jesus we may come into God’s presence with the confidence of a child. No man is needed to act as a mediator. Through Jesus we may open our hearts to God as to one who knows and loves us.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">In the secret place of prayer, where no eye but God’s can see, no ear but His can hear, we may pour out our most hidden desires and longings to the Father of infinite pity, and in the hush and <span class="pagebreak">[183]</span> silence of the soul that voice which never fails to answer the cry of human need will speak to our hearts.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">“The Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="James 5:11">James 5:11</span>. He waits with unwearied love to hear the confessions of the wayward and to accept their penitence. He watches for some return of gratitude from us, as the mother watches for the smile of recognition from her beloved child. He would have us understand how earnestly and tenderly His heart yearns over us. He invites us to take our trials to His sympathy, our sorrows to His love, our wounds to His healing, our weakness to His strength, our emptiness to His fullness. Never has one been disappointed who came unto Him. “They looked unto Him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Psalm 34:5">Psalm 34:5</span>.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Those who seek God in secret telling the Lord their needs and pleading for help, will not plead in vain. “Thy Father which seeth in secret Himself shall reward thee openly.” As we make Christ our daily companion we shall feel that the powers of an unseen world are all around us; and by looking unto Jesus we shall become assimilated to His image. By beholding we become changed. The character is softened, refined, and ennobled for the heavenly kingdom. The sure result of our intercourse and fellowship with our Lord will be to increase piety, purity, and fervor. There will be a growing intelligence in prayer. We are receiving a divine education, and this is illustrated in a life of diligence and zeal.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">The soul that turns to God for its help, its support, its power, by daily, earnest prayer, will have noble aspirations, clear perceptions of truth and duty, lofty purposes of action, and a continual hungering and thirsting after righteousness. By maintaining a connection with God, we shall be enabled to diffuse to others, through our association with them, the light, the peace, the serenity, that rule in our hearts. The strength acquired in prayer to God, united with persevering effort in training the mind in thoughtfulness and care-taking, prepares one for daily duties and keeps the spirit in peace under all circumstances.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MB 84.1">Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing, 84, 85</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[184]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-indented">There are some, I fear, who do not take their troubles to God in private prayer, but reserve them for the prayer meeting, and there do up their praying for several days. Such may be named conference and prayer meeting killers. They emit no light; they edify no one. Their cold, frozen prayers and long, backslidden testimonies cast a shadow. All are glad when they get through, and it is almost impossible to throw off the chill and darkness which their prayers and exhortations bring into the meeting. From the light which I have received, our meetings should be spiritual and social, and not too long. Reserve, pride, vanity, and fear of man should be left at home. Little differences and prejudices should not be taken with us to these meetings. As in a united family, simplicity, meekness, confidence, and love should exist in the hearts of brethren and sisters who meet to be refreshed and invigorated by bringing their lights together.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="2T 578.1">Testimonies for the Church 2:578, 579</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Secret prayer provides a clear picture of self</strong>—Nothing will give such clear views of self as secret prayer. He who seeth in secret and knoweth all things, will enlighten your understanding and answer your petitions. Plain, simple duties that must not be neglected will open before you.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="5T 163.1">Testimonies for the Church 5:163</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Private prayer cultivates a noble character</strong>—Amid the perils of these last days, the only safety of the youth lies in ever-increasing watchfulness and prayer. The youth who finds his joy in reading the word of God, and in the hour of prayer, will be constantly refreshed by drafts from the fountain of life. He will attain a height of moral excellence and a breadth of thought of which others can not conceive. Communion with God encourages good thoughts, noble aspirations, clear perceptions of truth, and lofty purposes of action. Those who thus connect themselves with God are acknowledged by Him as His sons and daughters. They are constantly reaching higher and still higher, obtaining clearer views of God and of eternity, until the Lord makes them channels of light and wisdom to the world. <span class="pagebreak">[185]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-indented">But prayer is not understood as it should be. Our prayers are not to inform God of something He does not know. The Lord is acquainted with the secrets of every soul. Our prayers need not be long and loud. God reads the hidden thought. We may pray in secret, and He who sees in secret will hear, and will reward us openly.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">The prayers that are offered to God to tell Him of all our wretchedness, when we do not feel wretched at all, are the prayers of hypocrisy. It is the contrite prayer that the Lord regards. “For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.”(<span class="egw-eng" title="YI 8-18-1898">The Youth’s Instructor, August 18, 1898</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Spiritual strength comes through private prayer</strong>—Those who will put on the whole armor of God and devote some time every day to meditation and prayer and to the study of the Scriptures will be connected with heaven and will have a saving, transforming influence upon those around them. Great thoughts, noble aspirations, clear perceptions of truth and duty to God, will be theirs. They will be yearning for purity, for light, for love, for all the graces of heavenly birth. Their earnest prayers will enter into that within the veil. This class will have a sanctified boldness to come into the presence of the Infinite One. They will feel that heaven’s light and glories are for them, and they will become refined, elevated, ennobled by this intimate acquaintance with God. Such is the privilege of true Christians.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Abstract meditation is not enough; busy action is not enough; both are essential to the formation of Christian character. Strength acquired in earnest, secret prayer prepares us to withstand the allurements of society. And yet we should not exclude ourselves from the world, for our Christian experience is to be the light of the world. The society of unbelievers will do us no harm if we mingle with them for the purpose of connecting them with God and are strong enough spiritually to withstand their influence.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="5T 112.1">Testimonies for the Church 5:112, 113</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[186]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>God accepts silent prayer</strong>—The Lord will accept even the silent petition of a burdened heart.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="2BC 1014.1">The SDA Bible Commentary 2:1014</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer must precede witnessing</strong>—Personal effort for others should be preceded by much secret prayer; for it requires great wisdom to understand the science of saving souls. Before communicating with men, commune with Christ. At the throne of heavenly grace obtain a preparation for ministering to the people.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="COL 149.1">Christ’s Object Lessons, 149</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">We must receive light and blessing, that we may have something to impart. It is the privilege of every worker first to talk with God in the secret place of prayer and then to talk with the people as God’s mouthpiece. Men and women who commune with God, who have an abiding Christ, make the very atmosphere holy, because they are co-operating with holy angels. Such witness is needed for this time.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="6T 52.1">Testimonies for the Church 6:52</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Work and prayer must be combined</strong>—We must live a twofold life—a life of thought and action, of silent prayer and earnest work.... The soul that turns to God for its strength, its support, its power, by daily, earnest prayer, will have noble aspirations, clear perceptions of truth and duty, lofty purposes of action, and a continual hungering and thirsting after righteousness.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="4T 459.1">Testimonies for the Church 4:459, 460</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">If the rush of work is allowed to drive us from our purpose of seeking the Lord daily, we shall make the greatest mistakes; we shall incur losses, for the Lord is not with us. We have closed the door so that He cannot find access to our souls. But if we pray, even when our hands are employed, the Saviour’s ear is open to hear our petitions.... God takes care of you in the place where it is your duty to be. But be sure, as often as possible, to go where prayer is wont to be made.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MM 216.1">Medical Ministry, 216</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[187]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-noindent"><strong>Use simple language in prayer</strong>—High-flown language is inappropriate in prayer, whether the petition be offered in the pulpit, in the family circle, or in secret. Especially should the one offering public prayer use simple language, that others may understand what is said and unite with the petition.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">It is the heart-felt prayer of faith that is heard in heaven and answered on earth.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="GW 177.1">Gospel Workers, 177</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>It is our privilege to kneel when in prayer</strong>—Both in public and in private worship it is our privilege to bow on our knees before God when we offer our petitions to Him. Jesus, our example, “kneeled down, and prayed.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Luke 22:41">Luke 22:41</span>. Of His disciples it is recorded that they, too, “kneeled down, and prayed.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Acts 9:40">Acts 9:40</span>. Paul declared, “I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Ephesians 3:14">Ephesians 3:14</span>. In confessing before God the sins of Israel, Ezra knelt. See <span class="bible-kjv" title="Ezra 9:5">Ezra 9:5</span>. Daniel “kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Daniel 6:10">Daniel 6:10</span>.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="PK 48.1">Prophets and Kings, 48</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Engage in no amusement that disqualifies you for private prayer</strong>—Any amusement in which you can engage asking the blessing of God upon it in faith, will not be dangerous. But any amusement which disqualifies you for secret prayer, for devotion at the altar of prayer, or for taking part in the prayer meeting, is not safe, but dangerous.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MYP 386.1">Messages to Young People, 386</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>God sees us in our secret prayer place</strong>—Like Nathanael, we need to study God’s word for ourselves, and pray for the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit. He who saw Nathanael under the fig tree will see us in the secret place of prayer. Angels from the world of light are near to those who in humility seek for divine guidance.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="DA 141.1">The Desire of Ages, 141</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Our prayers cannot be lost</strong>—It is a wonderful thing that we can pray effectually; that unworthy, erring mortals possess the power of offering their requests to God. What higher power can <span class="pagebreak">[188]</span> man desire than this,—to be linked with the infinite God? Feeble, sinful man has the privilege of speaking to his Maker. We may utter words that reach the throne of the Monarch of the universe. We may speak with Jesus as we walk by the way, and He says, I am at thy right hand. [See <span class="bible-kjv" title="Psalm 16:8">Psalm 16:8</span>.]</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">We may commune with God in our hearts; we may walk in companionship with Christ. When engaged in our daily labor, we may breathe out our heart’s desire, inaudible to any human ear; but that word cannot die away into silence, nor can it be lost. Nothing can drown the soul’s desire. It rises above the din of the street, above the noise of machinery. It is God to whom we are speaking, and our prayer is heard.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Ask, then; ask, and ye shall receive. Ask for humility, wisdom, courage, increase of faith. To every sincere prayer an answer will come. It may not come just as you desire, or at the time you look for it; but it will come in the way and at the time that will best meet your need. The prayers you offer in loneliness, in weariness, in trial, God answers, not always according to your expectations, but always for your good.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="GW 258.1">Gospel Workers, 258</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Let all who are afflicted or unjustly used, cry to God. Turn away from those whose hearts are as steel, and make your requests known to your Maker. Never is one repulsed who comes to Him with a contrite heart. Not one sincere prayer is lost. Amid the anthems of the celestial choir, God hears the cries of the weakest human being. We pour out our heart’s desire in our closets, we breathe a prayer as we walk by the way, and our words reach the throne of the Monarch of the universe. They may be inaudible to any human ear, but they cannot die away into silence, nor can they be lost through the activities of business that are going on. Nothing can drown the soul’s desire. It rises above the din of the street, above the confusion of the multitude, to the heavenly courts. It is God to whom we are speaking, and our prayer is heard.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="COL 174.1">Christ’s Object Lessons, 174</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[189]</span> </p>
