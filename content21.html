	<h2 class="chapterhead">Chapter 21—Divine Guidance Through Prayer</h2>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>We may learn God’s will for us through prayer</strong>—The Lord works in no haphazard way. Seek Him most earnestly in prayer. He will impress the mind, and will give tongue and utterance. The people of God are to be educated not to trust in human inventions and uncertain tests as a means of learning God’s will concerning them. Satan and his agencies are always ready to step into any opening to be found that will lead souls away from the pure principles of the Word of God. The people who are led and taught of God will give no place to devisings for which there is not a “Thus saith the Lord.”(<span class="egw-eng" title="2SM 326.1">Selected Messages 2:326</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Pray for God’s guidance</strong>—You must educate your judgment so that it shall not be feeble and inefficient. You must pray for guidance, and commit your way unto the Lord. You must close your heart against all foolishness and sin, and open it to every heavenly influence. You must make the most of your time and opportunities, in order to develop a symmetrical character.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="FE 302.1">Fundamentals of Christian Education, 302</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[223]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-indented">In every family there should be a fixed time for morning and evening worship. How appropriate it is for parents to gather their children about them before the fast is broken, to thank the heavenly Father for His protection during the night, and to ask Him for His help and guidance and watchcare during the day! How fitting, also, when evening comes, for parents and children to gather once more before Him and thank Him for the blessings of the day that is past!—(<span class="egw-eng" title="7T 43.1">Testimonies for the Church 7:43</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Consecrate yourself to God in the morning; make this your very first work. Let your prayer be, “Take me, O Lord, as wholly Thine. I lay all my plans at Thy feet. Use me today in Thy service. Abide with me, and let all my work be wrought in Thee.” This is a daily matter. Each morning consecrate yourself to God for that day. Surrender all your plans to Him, to be carried out or given up as His providence shall indicate. Thus day by day you may be giving your life into the hands of God, and thus your life will be molded more and more after the life of Christ.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="SC 70.1">Steps to Christ, 70</span>).</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">You must learn to see with your brain as well as your eyes. You must educate your judgment so that it shall not be feeble and inefficient. You must pray for guidance, and commit your way unto the Lord. You must close your heart against all foolishness and sin, and open it to every heavenly influence. You must make the most of your time and opportunities, in order to develop a symmetrical character.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="SD 283.1">Sons and Daughters of God, 283</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer for God’s guidance may be offered anytime, anywhere</strong>—There is no time or place in which it is inappropriate to offer up a petition to God. There is nothing that can prevent us from lifting up our hearts in the spirit of earnest prayer. In the crowds of the street, in the midst of a business engagement, we may send up a petition to God and plead for divine guidance, as <span class="pagebreak">[224]</span> did Nehemiah when he made his request before King Artaxerxes. A closet of communion may be found wherever we are. We should have the door of the heart open continually and our invitation going up that Jesus may come and abide as a heavenly guest in the soul.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="SC 99.1">Steps to Christ, 99</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">To pray as Nehemiah prayed in his hour of need is a resource at the command of the Christian under circumstances when other forms of prayer may be impossible. Toilers in the busy walks of life, crowded and almost overwhelmed with perplexity, can send up a petition to God for divine guidance. Travelers by sea and land, when threatened with some great danger, can thus commit themselves to Heaven’s protection. In times of sudden difficulty or peril the heart may send up its cry for help to One who has pledged Himself to come to the aid of His faithful, believing ones whenever they call upon Him. In every circumstance, under every condition, the soul weighed down with grief and care, or fiercely assailed by temptation, may find assurance, support, and succor in the unfailing love and power of a covenant-keeping God.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="PK 631.1">Prophets and Kings, 631, 632</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Angels are near to help as we pray for God’s guidance</strong>—Like Nathanael, we need to study God’s word for ourselves, and pray for the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit. He who saw Nathanael under the fig tree will see us in the secret place of prayer. Angels from the world of light are near to those who in humility seek for divine guidance.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="DA 141.1">The Desire of Ages, 141</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">The visible and the invisible world are in close contact. Could the veil be lifted, we would see evil angels pressing their darkness around us and working with all their power to deceive and destroy. Wicked men are surrounded, influenced, and aided by evil spirits. The man of faith and prayer has yielded his soul to divine guidance, and angels of God bring to him light and strength from heaven.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="5T 199.1">Testimonies for the Church 5:199</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[225]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-indented">A knowledge of the truth depends not so much upon strength of intellect as upon pureness of purpose, the simplicity of an earnest, dependent faith. To those who in humility of heart seek for divine guidance, angels of God draw near. The Holy Spirit is given to open to them the rich treasures of the truth.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="COL 59.1">Christ’s Object Lessons, 59</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Whatever we need, we may claim in prayer</strong>—Every promise in the word of God furnishes us with subject matter for prayer, presenting the pledged word of Jehovah as our assurance. Whatever spiritual blessing we need, it is our privilege to claim through Jesus. We may tell the Lord, with the simplicity of a child, exactly what we need. We may state to Him our temporal matters, asking Him for bread and raiment as well as for the bread of life and the robe of Christ’s righteousness. Your heavenly Father knows that you have need of all these things, and you are invited to ask Him concerning them. It is through the name of Jesus that every favor is received. God will honor that name, and will supply your necessities from the riches of His liberality.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MB 133.1">Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing, 133</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Parents to pray for God’s guidance</strong>—Parents, humble your hearts before God. Begin a thorough work with your children. Plead with the Lord to forgive your disregard of His Word in neglecting to train your children in the way they should go. Ask for light and guidance, for a tender conscience, and for clear discernment that you may see your mistakes and failures. God will hear such prayers from a humble and contrite heart.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="CG 557.1">Child Guidance, 557</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Those willing to be guided may know God’s will</strong>—The Lord reveals His will to those who are earnest and anxious to be guided. The reason for your inefficiency is that you have given up the idea of knowing and doing the will of God, therefore you do not know anything positively.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="3T 466.1">Testimonies for the Church 3:466</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[226]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-noindent"><strong>Search the scriptures with prayer for divine guidance</strong>—Those who are unwilling to accept the plain, cutting truths of the Bible are continually seeking for pleasing fables that will quiet the conscience. The less spiritual, self-denying, and humiliating the doctrines presented, the greater the favor with which they are received. These persons degrade the intellectual powers to serve their carnal desires. Too wise in their own conceit to search the Scriptures with contrition of soul and earnest prayer for divine guidance, they have no shield from delusion. Satan is ready to supply the heart’s desire, and he palms off his deceptions in the place of truth.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="GC 523.1">The Great Controversy, 523</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Trust God and he will direct your way</strong>—Many are unable to make definite plans for the future. Their life is unsettled. They cannot discern the outcome of affairs, and this often fills them with anxiety and unrest. Let us remember that the life of God’s children in this world is a pilgrim life. We have not wisdom to plan our own lives. It is not for us to shape our future. “By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Hebrews 11:8">Hebrews 11:8</span>.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Christ in His life on earth made no plans for Himself. He accepted God’s plans for Him, and day by day the Father unfolded His plans. So should we depend upon God, that our lives may be the simple outworking of His will. As we commit our ways to Him, He will direct our steps.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Too many, in planning for a brilliant future, make an utter failure. Let God plan for you. As a little child, trust to the guidance of Him who will “keep the feet of His saints.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="1 Samuel 2:9">1 Samuel 2:9</span>. God never leads His children otherwise than they would choose to be led, if they could see the end from the beginning and discern the glory of the purpose which they are fulfilling as co-workers with Him.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MH 478.1">The Ministry of Healing, 478, 479</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">If you have given yourself to God, to do His work, you have <span class="pagebreak">[227]</span> no need to be anxious for tomorrow. He whose servant you are, knows the end from the beginning. The events of tomorrow, which are hidden from your view, are open to the eyes of Him who is omnipotent.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">When we take into our hands the management of things with which we have to do, and depend upon our own wisdom for success, we are taking a burden which God has not given us, and are trying to bear it without His aid. We are taking upon ourselves the responsibility that belongs to God, and thus are really putting ourselves in His place. We may well have anxiety and anticipate danger and loss, for it is certain to befall us. But when we really believe that God loves us and means to do us good we shall cease to worry about the future. We shall trust God as a child trusts a loving parent. Then our troubles and torments will disappear, for our will is swallowed up in the will of God.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MB 100.1">Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing, 100, 101</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Eliezer prayed for—and received—God’s guidance</strong>—Remembering the words of Abraham, that God would send His angel with him, he prayed earnestly for positive guidance. In the family of his master he was accustomed to the constant exercise of kindness and hospitality, and he now asked that an act of courtesy might indicate the maiden whom God had chosen.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Hardly was the prayer uttered before the answer was given. Among the women who were gathered at the well, the courteous manners of one attracted his attention. As she came from the well, the stranger went to meet her, asking for some water from the pitcher upon her shoulder. The request received a kindly answer, with an offer to draw water for the camels also, a service which it was customary even for the daughters of princes to perform for their fathers’ flocks and herds. Thus the desired sign was given.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="PP 172.1">Patriarchs and Prophets, 172</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[228]</span> </p>
