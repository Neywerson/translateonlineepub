	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer an important part of success in soulwinning</strong>—If the members of the churches would but put to work the powers of mind that they have, in well-directed efforts, in well-matured plans, they might do a hundredfold more for Christ than they are now doing. If they went forth with earnest prayer, with meekness and lowliness of heart, seeking, personally to impart to others the knowledge of salvation, the message might reach the inhabitants of the earth.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="RH 4-11-1893">The Review and Herald, April 11, 1893</span>).</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">We are to come to God in faith, and pour out our supplications before Him, believing that He will work in our behalf, and in behalf of those we are seeking to save. We are to devote more time to earnest prayer.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="3BC 1146.1">SDA Bible Commentary 3:146, 1147</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Select another and still another soul, daily seeking guidance from God, laying everything before Him in earnest prayer, and working in divine wisdom. As you do this, you will see that God will give the Holy Spirit to convict, and the power of truth to convert, the soul.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MM 245.1">Medical Ministry, 245</span>). <span class="pagebreak">[40]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Bear in mind that the success of reproof depends greatly upon the spirit in which it is given. Do not neglect earnest prayer that you may possess a lowly mind, and that angels of God may go before you to work upon the hearts you are trying to reach, and so soften them by heavenly impressions that your efforts may avail.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="2T 53.1">Testimonies for the Church 2:53</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">If several should meet together with one accord, with hearts burdened for perishing souls, and should offer earnest, fervent prayers, they would prove effectual.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="RH 8-23-1892">The Review and Herald, August 23, 1892</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Praying for souls will bring us closer to God</strong>—As we seek to win others to Christ, bearing the burden of souls in our prayers, our own hearts will throb with the quickening influence of God’s grace; our own affections will glow with more divine fervor; our whole Christian life will be more of a reality, more earnest, more prayerful.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="COL 354.1">Christ’s Object Lessons, 354</span>).</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">When self dies, there will be awakened an intense desire for the salvation of others,—a desire which will lead to persevering efforts to do good. There will be a sowing beside all waters; and earnest supplication, importunate prayers, will enter heaven in behalf of perishing souls.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="GW 470.1">Gospel Workers, 470</span>).</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Come together to pray for the conversion of souls</strong>—If in one place there are only two or three who know the truth, let them form themselves into a band of workers. Let them keep their bond of union unbroken, pressing together in love and unity, encouraging one another to advance, each gaining courage and strength from the assistance of the others.... As they work and pray in Christ’s name, their numbers will increase.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="7T 21.1">Testimonies for the Church 7:21</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Let the Los Angeles church have special seasons of prayer daily for the work that is being done. The blessing of the Lord will <span class="pagebreak">[41]</span> come to the church members who thus participate in the work, gathering in small groups daily to pray for its success. Thus the believers will obtain grace for themselves, and the work of the Lord will be advanced.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="Ev 111.1">Evangelism, 111, 112</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">We should hold convocations for prayer, asking the Lord to open the way for the truth to enter the strongholds where Satan has set up his throne, and dispel the shadow he has cast athwart the pathway of those who he is seeking to deceive and destroy.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="6T 80.1">Testimonies for the Church 6:80</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Oh, that the earnest prayer of faith may arise everywhere, Give me souls buried now in the rubbish of error, or I die! Bring them to the knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="TDG 171.1">This Day With God, 171</span>).</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Everyone can pray for souls</strong>—Not all are called to personal labor in foreign fields, but all can do something by their prayers and their gifts to aid the missionary work.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="6T 29.1">Testimonies for the Church 6:29</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Brethren and sisters, have you forgotten that your prayers should go out, like sharp sickles, with the laborers in the great harvest field?—(<span class="egw-eng" title="3T 162.1">Testimonies for the Church 3:162</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Let those who are spiritual converse with these souls. Pray with and for them. Let much time be spent in prayer and close searching of the word. Let all obtain the real facts of faith in their own souls through belief that the Holy Spirit will be imparted to them because they have a real hungering and thirsting after righteousness.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="6T 65.1">Testimonies for the Church 6:65</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">When the gospel net is cast, let there be a watching by the net, with tears and earnest prayer. Let the workers determine not to become discouraged; and not to let go the net until it is drawn <span class="pagebreak">[42]</span> ashore, with the fruit of their labor.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="ST 3-16-1882">The Signs of the Times, March 16, 1882</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">How can we honor God, how can we vindicate His word, unless we are much in prayer appealing to Him to manifest His power in behalf of the perishing?—(<span class="egw-eng" title="RH 8-23-1892">The Review and Herald, August 23, 1892</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Personal soulwinning efforts made successful by prayer</strong>—I determined that my efforts should never cease till these dear souls, for whom I had so great an interest, yielded to God. Several entire nights were spent by me in earnest prayer for those whom I had sought out and brought together for the purpose of laboring and praying with them....</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">At every one of our little meetings I continued to exhort and pray for each one separately, until every one had yielded to Jesus, acknowledging the merits of His pardoning love. Every one was converted to God.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="1T 33.1">Testimonies for the Church 1:33, 34</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer for souls takes the mind from its own small concerns</strong>—Solicit prayer for the souls for whom you labor; present them before the church as objects for the supplication. It will be just what the church needs, to have their minds called from their little, petty difficulties, to feel a great burden, a personal interest, for a soul that is ready to perish.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MM 244.1">Medical Ministry, 244, 245</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Pray for greater efficiency in soulwinning</strong>—Oh, let it be seen, my brethren, that Jesus is abiding in the heart, sustaining, strengthening, comforting. It is your privilege to be endowed, from day to day, with a rich measure of His Holy Spirit, and to have broadened views of the importance and scope of the message we are proclaiming to the world. The Lord is willing to reveal to you wondrous things out of His law. Wait before Him with humility of heart. <span class="pagebreak">[43]</span> Pray most earnestly for an understanding of the times in which we live, for a fuller conception of His purpose, and for increased efficiency in soul saving.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="TM 513.1">Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, 513, 514</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">There are many souls yearning unutterably for light, for assurance and strength beyond what they have been able to grasp. They need to be sought out and labored for patiently, perseveringly. Beseech the Lord in fervent prayer for help. Present Jesus because you know Him as your personal Saviour. Let His melting love, His rich grace, flow forth from human lips. You need not present doctrinal points unless questioned. But take the Word, and with tender, yearning love for souls, show them the precious righteousness of Christ, to whom you and they must come to be saved.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="Ev 442.1">Evangelism, 442</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">The disciples prayed with intense earnestness for a fitness to meet men and in their daily intercourse to speak words that would lead sinners to Christ. Putting away all differences, all desire for the supremacy, they came close together in Christian fellowship. They drew nearer and nearer to God, and as they did this they realized what a privilege had been theirs in being permitted to associate so closely with Christ. Sadness filled their hearts as they thought of how many times they had grieved Him by their slowness of comprehension, their failure to understand the lessons that, for their good, He was trying to teach them.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">These days of preparation were days of deep heart searching. The disciples felt their spiritual need and cried to the Lord for the holy unction that was to fit them for the work of soul saving. They did not ask for a blessing for themselves merely. They were weighted with the burden of the salvation of souls. They realized that the gospel was to be carried to the world, and they claimed the power that Christ had promised.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="AA 37.1">The Acts of the Apostles, 37</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Much prayer is needed to know how to approach individuals with truth</strong>—It is not everyone who can labor judiciously <span class="pagebreak">[44]</span> for the salvation of souls. There is much close thinking to be done. We must not enter into the Lord’s work haphazard and expect success. The Lord needs men of mind, men of thought. Jesus calls for co-workers, not blunderers. God wants right-thinking and intelligent men to do the great work necessary to the salvation of souls.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Mechanics, lawyers, merchants, men of all trades and professions, educate themselves that they may become masters of their business. Should the followers of Christ be less intelligent, and while professedly engaged in His service be ignorant of the ways and means to be employed? The enterprise of gaining everlasting life is above every earthly consideration. In order to lead souls to Jesus there must be a knowledge of human nature and a study of the human mind. Much careful thought and fervent prayer are required to know how to approach men and women upon the great subject of truth.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="4T 67.1">Testimonies for the Church 4:67</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer accomplishes more in soul winning than words alone</strong>—Satan is on your track. He is an artful opponent, and the malignant spirit which you meet in your work is inspired by him. Those whom he controls echo his words. If the veil could be rent away from their eyes, those thus worked would see Satan plying all his arts to win them from the truth. In rescuing souls from his devices, far more will be accomplished by Christlike, humble prayer than by many words without prayer.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="CM 81.1">Colporteur Ministry, 81</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">God calls for modest, quiet, sober-minded youth, and men of mature age, who are well balanced with principle, who can pray as well as talk, who will rise up before the aged, and treat gray hairs with respect.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">The cause of God is suffering for want of laborers of understanding and mental power. My brethren and sisters, the Lord has blessed you with intellectual faculties capable of vast improvement. Cultivate your talents with persevering earnestness. Train and discipline the mind by study, by observation, by reflection. You cannot <span class="pagebreak">[45]</span> not meet the mind of God unless you put to use every power. The mental faculties will strengthen and develop if you will go to work in the fear of God, in humility, and with earnest prayer. A resolute purpose will accomplish wonders. Be open, firm, decided Christians. Exalt Jesus, talk of His love, tell of His power, and thus let your light shine forth to the world.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="LS 257.1">Life Sketches, 275</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Pray for souls</strong>—Begin to pray for souls; come near to Christ, close to His bleeding side. Let a meek and quiet spirit adorn your lives, and let your earnest, broken, humble petitions ascend to Him for wisdom that you may have success in saving not only your own soul, but the souls of others. Pray more than you sing. Do you not stand in greater need of prayer than of singing? Young men and women, God calls upon you to work, work for Him. Make an entire change in your course of action. You can do work that those who minister in word and doctrine cannot do. You can reach a class whom the minister cannot affect.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="1T 513.1">Testimonies for the Church 1:513</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Let us also pray earnestly in behalf of those whom we expect to visit, by living faith bringing them, one by one, into the presence of God.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="ChS 169.1">Christian Service, 169</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Work among the lowly, the poor, and the oppressed. We should pray for and with the helpless ones who have not strength of will to control the appetites that passion has degraded. Earnest, persevering effort must be made for the salvation of those in whose hearts an interest is awakened.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="6T 84.1">Testimonies for the Church 6:84</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[46]</span> </p>
