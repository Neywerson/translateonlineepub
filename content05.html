	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>God promises to hear and answer prayer</strong>—Christ is the connecting link between God and man. He has promised His personal intercession by employing His name. He places the whole virtue of His righteousness on the side of the suppliant. Christ pleads for man, and man, in need of divine help, pleads for himself in the presence of God, using the power of the influence of the One who gave His life for the world. As we acknowledge before God our appreciation of Christ’s merits, fragrance is given to our intercessions. Oh, who can value this great mercy and love! As we approach God through the virtue of Christ’s merits, we are clothed with His priestly vestments. He places us close by His side, encircling us with His human arm, while with His divine arm He grasps the throne of the Infinite. He puts His merits, as sweet incense, in a censer in our hands, in order to encourage our petitions. He promises to hear and answer our supplications.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="6BC 1078.7">SDA Bible Commentary 6:1078</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">The simple prayers indited by the Holy Spirit will ascend through the gates ajar, the open door which Christ has declared: I <span class="pagebreak">[47]</span> have opened, and no man can shut. These prayers, mingled with the incense of the perfection of Christ, will ascend as fragrance to the Father, and answers will come.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="6T 467.1">Testimonies for the Church 6:467</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">I saw that every prayer which is sent up in faith from an honest heart will be heard of God and answered, and the one that sent up the petition will have the blessing when he needs it most, and it will often exceed his expectations. Not a prayer of a true saint is lost if sent up in faith from an honest heart.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="1T 121.1">Testimonies for the Church 1:121</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">To pray as Nehemiah prayed in his hour of need is a resource at the command of the Christian under circumstances when other forms of prayer may be impossible. Toilers in the busy walks of life, crowded and almost overwhelmed with perplexity, can send up a petition to God for divine guidance. Travelers by sea and land, when threatened with some great danger, can thus commit themselves to Heaven’s protection. In times of sudden difficulty or peril the heart may send up its cry for help to One who has pledged Himself to come to the aid of His faithful, believing ones whenever they call upon Him. In every circumstance, under every condition, the soul weighed down with grief and care, or fiercely assailed by temptation, may find assurance, support, and succor in the unfailing love and power of a covenant-keeping God.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="PK 631.1">Prophets and Kings, 631, 632</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>If we ask, God will answer</strong>—It is a part of God’s plan to grant us, in answer to the prayer of faith, that which He would not bestow did we not thus ask.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="GC 525.1">The Great Controversy, 525</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">God hears prayer. Christ has said, “If ye shall ask anything in My name, I will do it.” Again He says, “If any man serve Me, him will My Father honor.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="John 14:14">John 14:14</span>; <span class="bible-kjv" title="John 12:26">John 12:26</span>. If we live according to His word, every precious promise He has given will be fulfilled to <span class="pagebreak">[48]</span> us. We are undeserving of His mercy, but as we give ourselves to Him, He receives us. He will work for and through those who follow Him.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MH 226.1">The Ministry of Healing, 226, 227</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">As you ask the Lord to help you, honor your Saviour by believing that you do receive His blessing. All power, all wisdom, are at our command. We have only to ask.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="MH 514.1">The Ministry of Healing, 514</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">God has a heaven full of blessings that He wants to bestow on those who are earnestly seeking for that help which the Lord alone can give.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="SD 123.1">Sons and Daughters of God, 123</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Jesus presents our poorlyworded prayers to the father</strong>—Every sincere prayer is heard in heaven. It may not be fluently expressed; but if the heart is in it, it will ascend to the sanctuary where Jesus ministers, and He will present it to the Father without one awkward, stammering word, beautiful and fragrant with the incense of His own perfection.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="DA 667.1">The Desire of Ages, 667</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Strength to overcome temptation given to those who pray</strong>—All are accountable for their actions while in this world upon probation. All have power to control their actions if they will. If they are weak in virtue and purity of thoughts and acts, they can obtain help from the Friend of the helpless. Jesus is acquainted with all the weaknesses of human nature, and, if entreated, will give strength to overcome the most powerful temptations. All can obtain this strength if they seek for it in humility.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="CG 466.1">Child Guidance, 466, 467</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>God answers our prayers when and how he sees best</strong>—Every saint who comes to God with a true heart, and sends his honest petitions to Him in faith, will have his prayers answered. Your faith must not let go of the promises of God, if you do not see or feel the immediate answer to your prayers. Be not afraid to trust God. Rely upon His sure promise: “Ask, and ye shall receive.” <span class="pagebreak">[49]</span> God is too wise to err, and too good to withhold any good thing from His saints that walk uprightly. Man is erring, and although his petitions are sent up from an honest heart, he does not always ask for the things that are good for himself, or that will glorify God. When this is so, our wise and good Father hears our prayers, and will answer, sometimes immediately; but He gives us the things that are for our best good and His own glory. God gives us blessings; if we could look into His plan, we would clearly see that He knows what is best for us and that our prayers are answered. Nothing hurtful is given, but the blessing we need, in the place of something we asked for that would not be good for us, but to our hurt.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">I saw that if we do not feel immediate answers to our prayers, we should hold fast our faith, not allowing distrust to come in, for that will separate us from God. If our faith wavers, we shall receive nothing from Him. Our confidence in God should be strong; and when we need it most, the blessing will fall upon us like a shower of rain.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="1T 120.1">Testimonies for the Church 1:120, 121</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>God supplies wisdom in answer to prayer</strong>—The Lord has given us the promise, “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.” It is in the order of God that those who bear responsibilities should often meet together to counsel with one another, and to pray earnestly for that wisdom which He alone can impart. Unitedly make known your troubles to God. Talk less; much precious time is lost in talk that brings no light. Let brethren unite in fasting and prayer for the wisdom that God has promised to supply liberally.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="TM 499.1">Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, 499</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Christ’s grace is available even before we pray</strong>—Even before the prayer is uttered, ... grace from Christ goes forth to meet the grace that is working upon the human soul.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="COL 206.1">Christ’s Object Lessons, 206</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[50]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>We may claim his promises boldly</strong>—“If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.” When you pray, present this promise. It is our privilege to come to Him with holy boldness. As in sincerity we ask Him to let His light shine upon us, He will hear and answer us. But we must live in harmony with our prayers. They are of no avail if we walk contrary to them. I have seen a father who, after reading a portion of scripture and offering prayer, would often, almost as soon as he had risen from his knees, begin to scold his children. How could God answer the prayer he had offered? And if, after scolding his children, a father offers prayer, does that prayer benefit the children? No; not unless it is a prayer of confession to God.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="CG 499.1">Child Guidance, 499</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Angels will assist us in answer to prayer</strong>—When about to speak passionately, close your mouth. Don’t utter a word. Pray before you speak, and heavenly angels will come to your assistance and drive back the evil angels, who would lead you to dishonor God, reproach His cause, and weaken your own soul.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="2T 82.1">Testimonies for the Church 2:82</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Angels will come to our side in answer to prayer</strong>—The guardianship of the heavenly host is granted to all who will work in God’s ways and follow His plans. We may in earnest, contrite prayer call the heavenly helpers to our side. Invisible armies of light and power will work with the humble, meek, and lowly one.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="1SM 97.1">Selected Messages 1:97</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>The gospel will make rapid progress as a result of prayer</strong>—God would work mightily for His people today if they would place themselves wholly under His guidance. They need the constant abiding of the Holy Spirit. If there were more prayer in the councils of those bearing responsibilities, more humbling of the heart before God, we should see abundant evidence of divine leadership, and our work would make rapid progress.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="8T 238.1">Testimonies for the Church 8:238</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[51]</span> </p>
	<p class="standard-noindent"><strong>Prayer will bring power to overcome</strong>—We must have on the whole armor of God and be ready at any moment for a conflict with the powers of darkness. When temptations and trials rush in upon us, let us go to God and agonize with Him in prayer. He will not turn us away empty, but will give us grace and strength to overcome, and to break the power of the enemy.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="EW 46.1">Early Writings, 46</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Blessings will be proportionate to our faith</strong>—Pray in faith. And be sure to bring your lives into harmony with your petitions, that you may receive the blessings for which you pray. Let not your faith weaken, for the blessings received are proportionate to the faith exercised. “According to your faith be it unto you.”“All things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Matthew 9:29">Matthew 9:29</span>; <span class="bible-kjv" title="Matthew 21:22">Matthew 21:22</span>. Pray, believe, rejoice. Sing praises to God because He has answered your prayers. Take Him at His word. “He is faithful that promised.” <span class="bible-kjv" title="Hebrews 10:23">Hebrews 10:23</span>. Not one sincere supplication is lost. The channel is open; the stream is flowing. It carries with it healing properties, pouring forth a restoring current of life and health and salvation.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="7T 274.1">Testimonies for the Church 7:274</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[52]</span> </p>
