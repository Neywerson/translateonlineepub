	<h2 class="chapterhead">Chapter 12—Prayer and Revival</h2>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Revival will come only in answer to prayer</strong>—A revival of true godliness among us is the greatest and most urgent of all our needs. To seek this should be our first work. There must be earnest effort to obtain the blessing of the Lord, not because God is not willing to bestow His blessing upon us, but because we are unprepared to receive it. Our Heavenly Father is more willing to give His Holy Spirit to them that ask Him, than are earthly parents to give good gifts to their children. But it is our work, by confession, humiliation, repentance, and earnest prayer, to fulfill the conditions upon which God has promised to grant us His blessing. A revival need be expected only in answer to prayer.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="1SM 121.1">Selected Messages 1:121</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">There is need today of such a revival of true heart-religion as was experienced by ancient Israel. We need, like them, to bring forth fruit meet for repentance,—to put away our sins, cleansing the defiled temple of the heart that Jesus may reign within. There is need of prayer—earnest, prevailing prayer. Our Saviour has left precious promises for the truly penitent petitioner. Such shall not <span class="pagebreak">[117]</span> seek His face in vain. He has also by His own example taught us the necessity of prayer. Himself the Majesty of Heaven, He often spent all night in communion with His Father. If the world’s Redeemer was not too pure, too wise, or too holy to seek help from God, surely weak, erring mortals have every need of that divine assistance. With penitence and faith, every true Christian will often seek “the throne of grace, that he may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.”(<span class="egw-eng" title="ST 1-26-1882">The Signs of the Times, January 26, 1882</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer brings us into connection with God</strong>—If we come to God, feeling helpless and dependent, as we really are, and in humble, trusting faith make known our wants to Him whose knowledge is infinite, who sees everything in creation, and who governs everything by His will and word, He can and will attend to our cry, and will let light shine into our hearts. Through sincere prayer we are brought into connection with the mind of the Infinite. We may have no remarkable evidence at the time that the face of our Redeemer is bending over us in compassion and love, but this is even so. We may not feel His visible touch, but His hand is upon us in love and pitying tenderness.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="SC 97.1">Steps to Christ, 97</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Our prayers ascend to heaven moist with Christ’s cleansing blood</strong>—The religious services, the prayers, the praise, the penitent confession of sin ascend from true believers as incense to the heavenly sanctuary, but passing through the corrupt channels of humanity, they are so defiled that unless purified by blood, they can never be of value with God. They ascend not in spotless purity, and unless the Intercessor, who is at God’s right hand, presents and purifies all by His righteousness, it is not acceptable to God. All incense from earthly tabernacles must be moist with the cleansing drops of the blood of Christ. He holds before the Father the censer of His own merits, in which there is no taint of earthly corruption. He gathers into this censer the prayers, the praise, and <span class="pagebreak">[118]</span> the confessions of His people, and with these He puts His own spotless righteousness. Then, perfumed with the merits of Christ’s propitiation, the incense comes up before God wholly and entirely acceptable. Then gracious answers are returned.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="1SM 344.1">Selected Messages 1:344</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>In prayer we sense the presence of Jesus</strong>—If we keep the Lord ever before us, allowing our hearts to go out in thanksgiving and praise to Him, we shall have a continual freshness in our religious life. Our prayers will take the form of a conversation with God as we would talk with a friend. He will speak His mysteries to us personally. Often there will come to us a sweet joyful sense of the presence of Jesus.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="COL 129.1">Christ’s Object Lessons, 129</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>The holy spirit came at pentecost in answer to prayer</strong>—The Spirit came upon the waiting, praying disciples with a fullness that reached every heart. The Infinite One revealed Himself in power to His church. It was as if for ages this influence had been held in restraint, and now Heaven rejoiced in being able to pour out upon the church the riches of the Spirit’s grace. And under the influence of the Spirit, words of penitence and confession mingled with songs of praise for sins forgiven. Words of thanksgiving and of prophecy were heard. All heaven bent low to behold and to adore the wisdom of matchless, incomprehensible love. Lost in wonder, the apostles exclaimed, “Herein is love.” They grasped the imparted gift. And what followed? The sword of the Spirit, newly edged with power and bathed in the lightnings of heaven, cut its way through unbelief. Thousands were converted in a day.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="AA 38.1">The Acts of the Apostles, 38</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>We should pray for the holy spirit as did the disciples at pentecost</strong>—The heart must be emptied of every defilement and cleansed for the indwelling of the Spirit. It was by the confession and forsaking of sin, by earnest prayer and consecration of themselves to God, that the early disciples prepared for the outpouring <span class="pagebreak">[119]</span> of the Holy Spirit on the Day of Pentecost. The same work, only in greater degree, must be done now....</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Unless we are daily advancing in the exemplification of the active Christian virtues, we shall not recognize the manifestations of the Holy Spirit in the latter rain. It may be falling on hearts all around us, but we shall not discern or receive it....</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Divine grace is needed at the beginning, divine grace at every step of advance, and divine grace alone can complete the work. There is no place for us to rest in a careless attitude. We must never forget the warnings of Christ, “Watch unto prayer,” “Watch, ... and pray always.” A connection with the divine agency every moment is essential to our progress. We may have had a measure of the Spirit of God, but by prayer and faith we are continually to seek more of the Spirit.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="TM 507.1">Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, 507, 508</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">We should pray as earnestly for the descent of the Holy Spirit as the disciples prayed on the day of Pentecost. If they needed it at that time, we need it more today.</p>
	<p class="standard-indented">Without the Spirit and power of God, it will be in vain that we labor to present the truth.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="AUCR 4-1-1898">(Australasian) Union Conference Record, April 1, 1898</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Claim the promise of the spirit by faith</strong>—Only to those who wait humbly upon God, who watch for His guidance and grace, is the Spirit given. The power of God awaits their demand and reception. This promised blessing, claimed by faith, brings all other blessings in its train. It is given according to the riches of the grace of Christ, and He is ready to supply every soul according to the capacity to receive.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="DA 672.1">The Desire of Ages, 672</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Pray for the latter rain</strong>—We must pray that God will unseal the fountain of the water of life. And we must ourselves receive of the living water. Let us, with contrite hearts, pray most earnestly that now, in the time of the latter rain, the showers of grace may fall upon us. At every meeting we attend our prayers should ascend, <span class="pagebreak">[120]</span> that at this very time God will impart warmth and moisture to our souls. As we seek God for the Holy Spirit, it will work in us meekness, humbleness of mind, a conscious dependence upon God for the perfecting latter rain. If we pray for the blessing in faith, we shall receive it as God has promised.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="TM 508.1">Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, 508</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Be fervent in prayer and in the power of the holy spirit</strong>—What we need is the quickening influence of the Holy Spirit of God. “Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.” Pray without ceasing, and watch by working in accordance with your prayers. As you pray, believe, trust in God. It is the time of the latter rain, when the Lord will give largely of His Spirit. Be fervent in prayer, and watch in the Spirit.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="TM 512.1">Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, 512</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Satan fears God’s people praying for the holy spirit</strong>—There is nothing that Satan fears so much as that the people of God shall clear the way by removing every hindrance, so that the Lord can pour out His Spirit upon a languishing church and an impenitent congregation. If Satan had his way, there would never be another awakening, great or small, to the end of time. But we are not ignorant of his devices. It is possible to resist his power. When the way is prepared for the Spirit of God, the blessing will come. Satan can no more hinder a shower of blessing from descending upon God’s people than he can close the windows of heaven that rain cannot come upon the earth. Wicked men and devils cannot hinder the work of God, or shut out His presence from the assemblies of His people, if they will, with subdued, contrite hearts, confess and put away their sins, and in faith claim His promises.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="1SM 124.1">Selected Messages 1:124</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>The spirit accompanies every sincere prayer</strong>—The religion that comes from God is the only religion that will lead to God. In order to serve Him aright, we must be born of the divine Spirit. This will purify the heart and renew the mind, giving us a new <span class="pagebreak">[121]</span> capacity for knowing and loving God. It will give us a willing obedience to all His requirements. This is true worship. It is the fruit of the working of the Holy Spirit. By the Spirit every sincere prayer is indited, and such prayer is acceptable to God. Wherever a soul reaches out after God, there the Spirit’s working is manifest, and God will reveal Himself to that soul. For such worshipers He is seeking. He waits to receive them, and to make them His sons and daughters.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="DA 189.1">The Desire of Ages, 189</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Prayer without earnest activity for others leads to formalism</strong>—God does not mean that any of us shall become hermits or monks, and retire from the world to devote ourselves to acts of worship. The life must be like Christ’s life,—between the mountain and the multitude. He who does nothing but pray will soon cease to pray, or his prayers will become a formal routine. When men take themselves out of social life, away from the sphere of Christian duty and cross-bearing; when they cease to work earnestly for the Master, who worked earnestly for them, they lose the subject matter of prayer, and have no incentive to devotion. Their prayers become personal and selfish. They cannot pray in regard to the wants of humanity or the upbuilding of Christ’s kingdom, pleading for strength wherewith to work.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="SC 101.1">Steps to Christ, 101</span>.)</p>
	<p class="standard-indented"><strong>Spiritual progress depends upon prayer</strong>—We must be much in prayer if we would make progress in the divine life. When the message of truth was first proclaimed, how much we prayed. How often was the voice of intercession heard in the chamber, in the barn, in the orchard, or the grove. Frequently we spent hours in earnest prayer, two or three together claiming the promise; often the sound of weeping was heard and then the voice of thanksgiving and the song of praise. Now the day of God is nearer than when we first believed, and we should be more earnest, more zealous, and fervent than in those early days. Our perils are greater now than then.—(<span class="egw-eng" title="5T 161.1">Testimonies for the Church 5:161, 162</span>.) <span class="pagebreak">[122]</span> </p>
